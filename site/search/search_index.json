(Replaced by WebLOAD Recorder.) Aborted  Rounds The  number of times the Virtual Clients started to run a script but did not  complete the script, during the last reporting interval. This might be due to  session being stopped either automatically or manually by the user. script Specification  of the sequence of HTTP protocol calls sent by Virtual Clients to the SUT  (System Under Test).  Scripts  are written in JavaScript. You can either write scripts as a text file or  generate them automatically using the WebLOAD Recorder. Application  Being Tested (ABT) See SUT. Attempted  Connections The  total number of times the Virtual Clients attempted to connect to the SUT  during the last reporting interval. Automatic  Transaction counters If you have Automatic  Transactions enabled, WebLOAD  creates three counters for each GET and POST statement in the script:  \u009f The total number of times it occurred  \u009f The number of times it succeeded  \u009f The number of times it failed during the last reporting interval Average For  timers, average is the total amount of time counted by the timer (not the  elapsed time) divided by the Count (that is, the total number of readings).  For example, the average for Transaction Time is the amount of time it took  to complete all the successful transactions divided by the number of  successful transactions (the Count). Built-in  Timer A timer  measures the time required to perform a given task. WebLOAD supports both  programmed timers and built-in timers. ROUND TIME is a built-in timer. The  ROUND TIME is the time needed for one complete execution of a script. Connect  Time The time  it takes for a Virtual Client to connect to the System Under Test (the SUT),  in seconds. In other words, the time it takes from the beginning of the HTTP  request to the TCP/IP connection.  The value posted in the Current  Value column is the average time it took a Virtual Client to connect to the  SUT during the last reporting interval.  If the  Persistent Connection option is enabled, there may not be a value for Connect  Time because the HTTP connection remains open between successive HTTP  requests. Connection  Speed (Bits Per Second) The  number of bits transmitted back and forth between the Virtual Clients and the  System Under Test (SUT) divided by the time it took to transmit those bits,  in seconds.  You can  set the Virtual Clients to emulate a particular connection speed during the  test, either by using the Variable Connection Speed settings, or by coding  the connection speed in the script.  If a  connection speed is specified for the test, WebLOAD reports it in the  Statistics Report.  The  value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of bits passed  per second during the last reporting interval. It should match, very closely,  the connection speed you specified for the test. Console The WebLOAD component that manages  the test session. The Console performs the following:  \u009f Configures Load Session hosts and scripts  \u009f Schedules Load Session scripts  \u009f Configures Goal\u2013Oriented test sessions  \u009f Monitors the application's performance  under the generated load  \u009f Manages the Load Session as it is  running, allowing you to pause, stop, and continue Load Session components as needed  \u009f Displays the current performance of the SUT  \u009f Provides a final performance reports for Probing Clients and Virtual Clients  Manages exporting of performance reports Count (For timers only.) The total number of readings (the number  of times the item being timed has occurred) for the timed statistic since the  beginning of the test. For example, for Transaction Time, Count shows the  number of transactions that have been completed. Current  Slice The value posted for this reporting interval in the  Statistics Report main window. Current  Slice Average For per  time unit statistics and counters, average is the total of all of the current  values for the last reporting interval, divided by the number of readings.  For timers, average is the total amount of time counted by  the timer (not the elapsed time) divided by the Count (that is, the total  number of readings for the last reporting interval). For example, the average  for Transaction Time is the amount of time it took to complete all the  successful transactions in the last reporting interval, divided by the number  of successful transactions (the Current Slice Count). Current  Slice Count (For  timers only.) The total number of readings (the number of times the item  being timed has occurred) for the timed statistic for the last reporting  interval. For example, for Transaction Time, Current Slice Count shows the  number of transactions that have been completed over the last reporting  interval. Current  Slice Max The  highest value reported for this statistic over the last reporting interval. Current  Slice Min The  lowest value reported for this statistic over the last reporting interval. Current  Slice Standard Deviation The  average amount the measurement for this statistic varies from the average  over the last reporting interval. Current  Slice Sum The  aggregate or total value for this statistic in this script over the last  reporting interval. DNS  Lookup Time The time  it takes to resolve the host name and convert it to an IP address by calling  the DNS server. Failed  Connections The total number of times the  Virtual Clients tried to connect to the SUT but were unsuccessful, during the  last reporting interval.  This  number is always less than or equal to the number of failed hits because hits  can fail for reasons other than a failed connection. Failed  Hits The total number of times the  Virtual Clients made an HTTP request but did not receive the correct HTTP response  from the SUT during the last reporting interval. Note that each request for  each gif, jpeg, html file, etc., is a single hit. Failed  Hits Per Second The  number of times the Virtual Clients did not obtain the correct HTTP response  divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.  The value posted in the Current  Value column is the number (sum) of unsuccessful HTTP requests per second  during the last reporting interval. Failed  Pages Per Second The  number of times the Virtual Clients did not obtain the correct response to an  upper level request, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.  The  value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of unsuccessful  requests per second during the last reporting interval. Failed  Rounds The  total number of times the Virtual Clients started but did not complete the  script during the last reporting interval. Failed  Rounds Per Second The  number of times the Virtual Clients started but did not complete an iteration  of the script, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds. The value posted in  the Current Value column is the number (sum) of failed iterations of the  script per second during the last reporting interval. First  Byte The time  it takes a Virtual Client to receive the first byte of data. Gallery See Templates Gallery. Goal\u2013Oriented  Test A  WebLOAD component enabling you to define the performance goals required, and  view the status of your application when it is operating under this  performance goal. WebLOAD provides a Goal\u2013Oriented Test Wizard for  configuring these performance goals. WebLOAD automatically accelerates the  number of Virtual Clients accessing your website until you meet your  performance goal.  Note:  The Goal-Oriented Test Wizard was  previously called the Cruise Control Wizard. Goal\u2013Oriented  Test Wizard See Goal\u2013Oriented   Test. Hit  Time The time  it takes to complete a successful HTTP request, in seconds. Each request for  each gif, jpeg, html file, etc., is a single hit. The time of a hit is  the sum of the Connect Time, Send Time, Response Time, and Process Time.  The value posted in the Current  Value column is the average time it took to make an HTTP request and process  its response during the last reporting interval. Hits The total number of times the  Virtual Clients made HTTP  requests to the System Under Test (SUT) during the last reporting interval.  For  example, a Get statement for a URL retrieves a page. The page can include any  number of graphics and contents files. Each request for each gif, jpeg, html file,  etc., is a single hit. Hits  Per Second The number of times the Virtual  Clients made an HTTP request divided by the elapsed time, in seconds. Each  request for each gif, jpeg, html file,  etc., is a single hit.  The value posted in the Current  Value column is the number (sum) of HTTP requests per second during the last  reporting interval. Host A computer connected via a  network, participating in a test session. Each Host in a test session has  assigned tasks. A host can act as either a Load Machine or a Probing Client  Machine. All hosts participating in a test session must be accessible to the  Console over a network. Therefore they must run TestTalk, the network agent. HTTP  Response Status WebLOAD  creates a row in the Statistics Report for each kind of HTTP status code it  receives as an HTTP response from the SUT (redirection codes, success codes,  server error codes, or client error codes).  The value posted is the number  of times the Virtual Clients received that status code during the last  reporting interval. Integrated  Reports A single configurable report  that can integrate both standard performance data, and data from the NT  Performance Monitor. This report gives you a more complete picture of the  performance of your application. The data to be monitored and the data to be  displayed in the report are both configurable in the Console. Internet  Productivity Pack (IPP) Provides a set of protocol  implementations enabling you to load-test your application using these  protocols. Java  and ActiveX counters You can  add function calls to your scripts that enable you to instantiate and call  methods and properties in Java and ActiveX components (see the WebLOAD  Scripting Guide). If there are ActiveX or Java function calls in the  script that you are running, WebLOAD reports three counters for them in the  Statistics Report:  \u009f The total number of times it occurred  \u009f The number of times it succeeded  \u009f The number of times it failed during the last reporting interval  The row heading in the  Statistics Report is the name of the function call. Java  and ActiveX timers You  can add function calls to your scripts that enable you to instantiate and  call methods and properties in Java and ActiveX components (see the WebLOAD  Scripting Guide). If there are ActiveX or Java function calls in the  script you are running, WebLOAD reports timers for them in the Statistics Report.  The  timer value is the average amount of time it took to complete the function  call, in seconds, during the last reporting interval.  The row  heading in the Statistics Report is the name of the function call. Load  Generator The  component of the Load Machine that generates Virtual Clients. Load Generators  have the task of bombarding the System Under Test with HTTP protocol call  requests as defined in the script. WebLOAD assesses the application's  performance by measuring the response  time experienced by the Virtual Clients. The number of Virtual Clients at any  given moment is determined by the user. Load  Generator Machine See  Load Machine. Load  Machine A  host that runs Load Generators. Load Generators bombard the application under  test with a large load, to enable complete scalability and integrity testing. Load  Session A Load  Session includes both the complete Load Template and the results obtained  while running that Load Session. A Load Template consists of information  about the hosts and scripts participating in the current Load Session. The  Load Template will also include scheduling information. The complete Load  Template is illustrated in the Session Tree. Storing a Load Template saves  you time when repeatedly running WebLOAD with the same, or even a similar  network configuration, since you don't have to recreate your Load Template  from scratch each time you want to start working.  Storing  Load Session results can be useful when you want to examine results from  multiple test sessions or for analyzing test session results. Load  Size The  number of Virtual Clients running during the last reporting interval. Load  Template A Load  Template contains the complete Load Session definition, without the test  results. A Load Template includes information about the participating hosts  and the scripts used in the current Load Session. The definition also  includes scheduling information and the configuration of the Server Monitor  and Integrated Reports. The complete Load Template is illustrated in the  Session Tree. Storing a Load Template saves you time when repeatedly running  WebLOAD with the same, or even a similar network configuration, since you do  not have to recreate your Load Template from scratch each time you rerun a  test. Page  Time The time  it takes to complete a successful upper level request, in seconds. The Page  Time is the sum of the Connect Time, Send Time, Response Time, and Process  Time for all the hits on a page.  The  value posted in the Current Value column is the average time it took the  Virtual Clients to make an upper level request and process its response  during the last reporting interval. Pages The  total number of times the Virtual Client made upper level requests, both successful  and unsuccessful, during the last reporting interval. Pages  Per Second The number of times the Virtual  Clients made upper level requests divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.  The  value posted in the Current Value column is  the number (sum) of requests per second during the last reporting interval. Per  Time Unit statistics Ratios that calculate an average  value for an action or process. For example: Transactions Per Second, Rounds  Per Second. Portfolio A Portfolio enables you to  generate a single, inclusive report that contains all the charts generated by  the templates included in the portfolio. Probing  Client A software program which  \"bombards\" the SUT as a single Virtual Client, to further measure  the performance of the SUT. WebLOAD generates exact values for Probing Client  performance. Probing  Client Machine Hosts running Probing Client  software simulating one Virtual Client, and run at the same time as Load  Machines. Probing  Client software See Probing   Client. Process  Time The time it takes WebLOAD to  parse an HTTP response from the SUT and then populate the document-object  model (DOM), in seconds.  The value posted in the Current  Value column is the average time it took WebLOAD to parse an HTTP response  during the last reporting interval. Receive  Time The elapsed time between  receiving the first byte and the last byte. Report  Portfolio See Portfolio. Resource  Manager Distributes  and circulates WebLOAD testing resources (Virtual Clients and Probing  Clients) amongst users on a \u201cneed to use\u201d basis. The Resource Manager is  packaged with a maximum number of Virtual Clients, Probing Clients and  Connected Workstation ports, as defined by the WebLOAD package.  With the Resource Manager, every  WebLOAD Console can operate in Standalone Workstation mode or Connected  Workstation mode. Response  Data Size The size, in bytes, of all the  HTTP responses sent by the SUT during the last reporting interval.  WebLOAD  uses this value to calculate Throughput (bytes per second). Response  Time The time  it takes the SUT to send the object of an HTTP request back to a Virtual  Client, in seconds. In other words, the time from the end of the HTTP request  until the Virtual Client has received the complete item it requested.  The value posted in the Current  Value column is the average time  it took the SUT to respond to an HTTP request during the last reporting interval. Responses The  number of times the SUT responded to an HTTP request during the last  reporting interval.  This  number should match the number of successful hits. Round  Time The time  it takes one Virtual Client to finish one complete iteration of a script, in  seconds.  The  value posted in the Current Value column is the average time it took the  Virtual Clients to finish one complete iteration of the script during the  last reporting interval. Rounds The  total number of times the Virtual Clients attempted to run the script during  the last reporting interval. Rounds  Per Second The number of times the Virtual  Clients attempted to run the script, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.  The  value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of attempts  (both successful and unsuccessful) per second during the last reporting  interval. Send  Time The time  it takes the Virtual Client to write an HTTP request to the SUT, in seconds.  The value posted in the Current  Value column is the average time it took the Virtual Clients to write a  request to the SUT during the last reporting interval. Server  Performance Measurements If you selected Performance  Monitor statistics for the report, WebLOAD creates a row for them and reports their values in the Statistics Report.  For definitions of the  statistics, see the Server Monitor  Definition dialog box.  Be  selective when choosing server performance measurements, otherwise the system  resources required to manage the data might affect the Console. Session  Tree A graphic representation of a  Load Template and status. It illustrates the different components of a test  session, including Load Machines and Probing Clients, the scripts that they  execute, and their status. Single  Client See Probing   Client. Standard  Deviation The average amount the  measurement varies from the average since the beginning of the test. Successful  Connections The  total number of times the Virtual Clients were able to successfully connect to the SUT during the last reporting  interval.  This number is always less than  or equal to the number of successful hits because several hits might use the same HTTP connection if the Persistent  Connection option is enabled. Successful  Hits The  total number of times the Virtual Clients made an HTTP request and received  the correct HTTP response from the SUT during the last reporting interval.  Each request for each gif, jpeg, html file,  etc., is a single hit. Successful  Hits Per Second The  number of times the Virtual Clients obtained the correct HTTP response to  their HTTP requests divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.  The  value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of successful  HTTP requests per second during the last reporting interval. Successful  Pages Per Second The  value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of successful  requests per second during the last reporting interval. Successful  Rounds The  total number of times the Virtual Clients completed one iteration of the  script during the last reporting interval. Successful  Rounds Per Second The  number of times the Virtual Clients completed an entire iteration of the  script, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.  The  value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of successful  iterations of the script per second during the last reporting interval. SUT The  system running the Web application currently under test. The SUT (System  Under Test) is accessed by clients through its URL address. The SUT can  reside on any machine or on multiple machines, anywhere on the global  Internet or your local intranet. Template See Load Template. Templates  Gallery The  Templates Gallery is a single entity that contains predefined templates,  user-defined templates, and portfolios. Test  Program See Test Script. Test  Script The  script. This defines the test scenario used in your Load Session. Scripts are  written in JavaScript. Test  Template See Load Template. TestTalk The  network agent. This program enables communication between the Console and the  host computers participating in the test. Throttle  Control A  WebLOAD component that enables you to dynamically change the Load Size while  a test session is in progress. Throughput  (Bytes Per Second) The  average number of bytes per second transmitted from the SUT to the Virtual  Clients running the script during the last reporting interval. In other  words, this is the amount of the Response Data Size, divided by the number of  seconds in the reporting interval. Time  to First Byte The time  it takes from when a request is sent until the Virtual Client receives the  first byte of data. User-defined  Automatic Data Collection If  you have Automatic Data Collection enabled, WebLOAD creates three counters  for each GET and POST statement in  the script.  \u009f The total number of times the Get and Post statements occurred  \u009f The number of times the statements succeeded  The number of times the statements failed during the last reporting interval User-defined  counters Your own  counters that you can add to scripts using the SendCounter() and the SendMeasurement() functions (see the WebLOAD Scripting Guide). If there is a  user-defined counter in the script that you are running, WebLOAD reports the  counter\u2019s values in the Statistics Report.  The row heading is the name  (argument) of the counter, that  is, the string in parenthesis in the SendCounter() or  SendMeasurement() function  call.  The value reported is the number  of times the counter was  incremented during the last reporting interval. User-defined  timer Timers  that you can add to scripts to keep track of the amount of time it takes to  complete specific actions (see the WebLOAD Scripting Guide). If there  are any timers in the scripts that you are running, WebLOAD reports their  values in the Statistics Report.  The  row heading is the name (argument) of the timer. That is, the row heading is  the string in parenthesis in the SetTimer() function call. The timer represents the time it  takes to complete all the actions between the SetTimer() call and its corresponding SendTimer() call,  in seconds.  The  value posted is the average time it took a Virtual Client to complete the  actions between the pair of timer calls, in seconds, during the last  reporting interval. User-defined  Transaction counters Transaction  functions that you can add to scripts for functional tests (see the WebLOAD  Scripting Guide). If there is a user-defined transaction function in the  script that you are running, WebLOAD reports three counters for it in the  Statistics Report.  \u009f The total number of times the  transaction occurred  \u009f The number of times a transaction succeeded  \u009f The number of times a transaction failed  during the last reporting interval  The  row heading is the name (argument) of the transaction. That is, the row  heading is the string in parenthesis in the BeginTransaction() function call User-defined  Transactions timers A timer for user-defined transaction functions. If  there is a user-defined transaction function in the script that you are  running, WebLOAD reports a timer for it in the Statistics Report.  The  row heading is the name (argument) of the user- defined transaction. That is,  the row heading is the string in parenthesis in the BeginTransaction() function call.  The timer represents the average  time it took to complete all the actions between the BeginTransaction() call and its corresponding EndTransaction() call, in seconds, during the last reporting  interval. Virtual  Client Artificial  entities run by Load Generators. Each such entity is a perfect simulation of  a real client accessing the System Under Test (SUT) through a Web browser.  Virtual Clients generate HTTP  calls that access the SUT. The  Load Generators that run Virtual Clients can reside anywhere on the Internet  or on your local intranet.  Scripts  are executed by all the Virtual Clients in parallel, achieving simultaneous  access to the SUT. The size of the load on your SUT is determined by the  number of Virtual Clients being  generated. You may define as many Virtual Clients as needed, up to the  maximum supported by your WebLOAD \u201cpackage\u201d. WebLOAD  Analytics WebLOAD  Analytics enables you to analyze data and create custom, informative reports  after running a WebLOAD test session. WebLOAD  Console See Console.

An important phase of the performance testing process is the analysis and reporting of test results. WebLOAD Analytics provides you with a simple yet comprehensive method of producing and publishing reports to fulfill all your analysis and reporting requirements. </p> <p>Using WebLOAD Analytics, you can create clear, accurate, and meaningful reports that enable you to analyze Load Session results and identify peaks, trends, and anomalies in your data. WebLOAD Analytics provides you with a variety of predefined chart templates that enable you to produce focused reports on specific topics. You can edit these templates, and create new templates. </p>"},{"location":"analytics/overview/#the-webload-analytics-workflow","title":"The WebLOAD Analytics Workflow","text":"<p>WebLOAD Analytics provides an easy to use, task oriented interface for the production and publication of Load Session reports. In a typical workflow, you create several charts of interest. Each is created simply by double-clicking a template. You then generate a Report, which is a compilation of the open charts.  </p> <p>The building blocks of the charts are:</p> <ul> <li>Load Sessions \u2013 WebLOAD Analytics uses Load Session data as the raw material for producing WebLOAD reports. Using WebLOAD Analytics, you can present Load Session results, compare various statistics, and highlight important results and conclusions, based on your load test results. For more information about Load Sessions, seeWorking with Load Sessions on page 51 . </li> <li>Templates \u2013 A template specifies the design of a chart, including the visual layout, chart elements, and the way the data is structured. WebLOAD Analytics provides a wide range of predefined templates, based on RadView\u2019s extensive knowledge and experience in the load testing and performance analysis fields. Predefined templates enable you to produce charts that focus on specific aspects of the Load Session data.</li> </ul> <p>A basic chart consists of the following elements: </p> <ul> <li>Tabular Data \u2013 Provides a tabular representation of the Load Session data. </li> <li>Graphs \u2013 Provides a graphical representation of the Load Session data. </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Each chart is either static or interactive.  </p> <ul> <li>A static chart, indicated by, is a regular chart.  </li> <li>An interactive chart is indicated by . It has the additional capability of enabling you to analyze and present the chart data in various ways using tools provided in its interactive toolbar. </li> </ul> <p>Once you create all the charts necessary for your report, you can generate the report simply by clicking . You then specify which of the open charts will be included in the report. </p> <p>Reports can be saved for later use, with the defined Load Session data, template, and any optional settings you choose (seeSaving Reports on page 48). </p> <p>In addition, you can: </p> <ul> <li>Apply filters to the Load Session data \u2013 You can apply time and statistics-based filters to the Load Session data before the chart is produced. Time filters focus the chart on a specific part of the Load Session. Statistics-based time filters enable you to focus on time segments which meet defined criteria. For information about filtering your chart, seeChanging Chart Settings on page 35. </li> <li>Customize your graphs \u2013 You can customize the graphs of interactive charts (denoted by the  icon): change colors, line type, hide/show measurement, zoom and more. You can even add any other measurement from the session to the graphs. </li> <li>Change the chart\u2019s parameters \u2013 each chart has different parameters that can be changed to control its behavior. Depending on the chart, you may add threshold values, control whether to show detailed data table or not, change titles and logos. For more information, seeModifying Chart Parameters on page 43. </li> <li>Reuse your customizations \u2013 You can change the settings of a template and then save it as a new template. </li> <li>Create regression charts \u2013 Adding multiple Load Sessions to a chart compares one selected session to all additional sessions included in the regression chart. This option is very useful for comparing two sessions that were run on the same Load Template. The purpose is to gauge whether a small change in the System Under Test has degraded the performance. For more information, seeGenerating Charts on page 21. </li> <li>Create statistical correlation charts \u2013 You can use these charts to identify measurements that have a high correlation with a certain measurement that is behaving in an unusual fashion, and are therefore possibly causing the unusual behavior of that measurement. </li> <li>Print or Publish the chart or report \u2013 Both charts and reports can be printed or published in a variety of formats, including DOC, ODT, PDF, HTML, RTF and XLSX. For information about printing charts and reports, seePrinting a Chart on page 27 andPrinting a Report on page 47. For information about publishing charts and Reports, seePublishing Charts on page 34 andPublishing Reports on page 47. </li> <li>Group frequently used templates in a portfolio \u2013 You can create a portfolio of templates that you use frequently. Opening the portfolio will open all its included templates. For information about how to set up a portfolio, seeWorking with Portfolios on page 64. </li> <li> <p>Manage your charts \u2013 You can group your templates into different categories by creating your own folders and moving the templates you wish to use into those folders. You can also rename folders to create logical categories in which to group your templates. For information about managing your templates, seeManaging Template Categories on page 59. </p> </li> <li> <p>Assign and modify master templates \u2013 WebLOAD Analytics contains three master templates: Raw, WebLOAD, and WebLOAD with background. Any one of these can be assigned as the master template for reports, and any one of these can be assigned as the master template for charts. By default, the reports master template is the WebLOAD master template, and the default charts master template is the Raw master template. The appearance of a report is determined only by the reports master template. The appearance of each chart is determined both by the chart master template and the settings of the specific template. You can specify which master template to assign to charts and which master template to assign to reports (seeDefining Your Analytics Preferences on page 67). You can also change the values of some master template parameters (seeDefining Your Parameter Preferences on page 71). </p> </li> <li>Create and edit static reports \u2013 Although it is possible to dynamically define an interactive report from any measurement set, you can even create and edit the static templates. You can use the freely available iReport tool to edit the supplied templates and create new ones.

The SUT (System Under Test) is accessed by clients through its URL address. The SUT can reside on any machine or on multiple machines, anywhere on the global Internet or your local intranet. Template See Load Template. Templates Gallery The Templates Gallery is a single entity that contains predefined templates, user-defined templates, and portfolios. Test Program See Test Script. Test Script The script. This defines the test scenario used in your Load Session. Scripts are written in JavaScript. Test Template See Load Template. TestTalk The network agent. This program enables communication between the Console and the host computers participating in the test. Throttle Control A WebLOAD component that enables you to dynamically change the Load Size while a test session is in progress. Throughput (Bytes Per Second) The average number of bytes per second transmitted from the SUT to the Virtual Clients running the script during the last reporting interval. In other words, this is the amount of the Response Data Size, divided by the number of seconds in the reporting interval. Time to First Byte The time that elapsed since a request was sent until the Virtual Client received the first byte of data. User-defined Automatic Data Collection <p>If you have Automatic Data Collection enabled, WebLOAD creates three counters for each GET and POST statement in the script:</p><p>- The total number of times the Get and Post statements occurred</p><p>- The number of times the statements succeeded</p><p>- The number of times the statements failed during the last reporting interval.</p> User-defined counters <p>Your own counters that you can add to scripts using the SendCounter() and the SendMeasurement() functions (see the WebLOAD Scripting Guide).

That is, the row heading is the string in parenthesis in the BeginTransaction() function call.</p><p>The timer represents the average time it took to complete all the actions between the BeginTransaction() call and its corresponding EndTransaction() call, in seconds, during the last reporting interval.</p> Virtual Client <p>Artificial entities run by Load Generators. Each such entity is a perfect simulation of a real client accessing the System Under Test (SUT) through a Web browser.</p><p>Virtual Clients generate HTTP calls that access the SUT. The Load Generators that run Virtual Clients can reside anywhere on the Internet or on your local intranet.</p><p>Scripts are executed by all the Virtual Clients in parallel, achieving simultaneous access to the SUT. The size of the load on your SUT is determined by the number of Virtual Clients being generated.

When you plan a test session, the first step is to analyze your application to ensure that your test will accurately reflect the working environment of your users. You want to consider the goals of the test and your available resources. Consider the following:</p> <ol> <li>What application are you testing?</li> </ol> <p>When planning a test, the first thing you should consider is the target of your test. You must define what Web application you plan to test. Your test target is your SUT (System Under Test).</p> <p>Before planning further, call up a browser and access the site to be tested, to make sure that the connection to the site on the Web is valid.</p> <ol> <li>What criteria are you testing?</li> </ol> <p>You must know what functionality of the Web application you want to test. Usually you want to test the amount of time required to perform a certain function on the website. You may want to test the time it takes to access a page, the time it takes to submit a form, or the number of clients that can simultaneously access your site.</p> <p>Using the Goal-Oriented Test, you can test the number of clients that can perform a function, such as accessing a page or submitting a form, at the performance level that you have specified.</p> <p>When defining the criteria for the test you should consider:</p> <ul> <li>How many users do you want to simulate? </li> <li>How many users are anticipated to connect to your application?</li> <li> <p>How many different user activities do you want to simulate? If you plan to test users performing different activities, you need to create separate scripts for each activity.</p> </li> <li> <p>What type of users do you want to simulate? First time users respond differently to an application than returning users. Using the playback sleep time settings you can set WebLOAD Virtual Clients to run with the recorded sleep time delays, remove all delays to stress the application, or create random delays simulating different users.</p> </li> <li> <p>What type of response time is acceptable? Using the Goal-Oriented Test, you can create test sessions that increase the load and notify you at what load the response time exceeds acceptable levels.</p> </li> <li> <p>What is an acceptable failure rate? Should your test be stopped if a set number or percentage of errors is surpassed?</p> </li> <li> <p>What type of connections speeds do you want to simulate? Using the connection speed settings available with WebLOAD Console you can simulate users connecting through different connections.</p> </li> <li> <p>What types of systems are testing these aspects?</p> </li> </ul> <p>Your test can include Load Machines and Probing Clients. A Load Machine bombards the SUT with a load of Virtual Clients. Load Machine testing gives you an indication of the way your program behaves under the stress of a heavy load.</p> <p>Probing Client testing is usually performed simultaneously with Load Machine testing. Using a Probing Client, you can test the system performance with other functionality, while the system is undergoing stress testing. For example, you can measure the time required to submit a form, while the SUT is being bombarded by the Load Machine simulating multiple clients calling up a page.</p> <p>WebLOAD Console generates exact values for Probing Client performance as opposed to averages for Load Machine performance.</p>"},{"location":"console/plan_test_session/#planning-a-test-program","title":"Planning a Test Program","text":"<p>The test you devise must be coded in a script file.

You should also consider your test objectives and define transactions to measure the response times for typical user activities such as searching for a book to ensure your Web application meets your requirements. You can also plan Synchronization Points to emulate peek server loads and ensure your requirements are met even under heavy load.

Ramp up time in minutes The time interval over  which to increase the load from 0 Virtual Users to the number of virtual  users specified in Max Virtual Users. Time to run Max Virtual Users in minutes The time interval during  which to run the load at the max number of Virtual Users Ramp down time in minutes The time interval over  which to decrease the load in order to return to 0 Virtual Users Load  Generators Select the load generator  machines as described in Specifying   Load Generators for a load test (on page 23). Recurrence Select this option if you  wish to schedule automatic periodic execution of the load test. Refer to Setting recurring test runs (on page 24). <p>The Script load test generates an increasing load over a set time frame until reaching a defined maximum load size. The maximum load size is then run for a set period after which the load is reduced back to the base load again over a time frame defined by the user. The load increments are calculated automatically by WebLOAD based on the parameters defined. </p> <p>Thus, the load will start with 0 Virtual Users and increase over the time frame defined in the Ramp up time field to reach the number of Virtual Users defined in the Max Virtual Users field. The test will then continue running with the maximum number of Virtual Clients for the period of time defined in the Time to run Max Virtual Users field, after which load will return to 0 Virtual Users value over the time frame set in the Ramp down time field. </p> <ol> <li> <p>Select one of the following: </p> </li> <li> <p>Create Test \u2013 The test definitions are saved. </p> </li> <li> <p>Create and Run Test \u2013 The test definitions are saved, and the test starts running immediately.</p> </li> <li> <p>Run in Sandbox Mode \u2013 The system saves all the test definitions, but runs a limited test on the settings specified in the Scripts section while ignoring all the settings in the Load Configuration, Load Generators, and Recurrence sections. </p> <p>This option is intended for SaaS users wishing to run a limited test prior to running the full test specified in the test definitions.  </p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"dashboard/manage_tests/#specifying-scripts-for-a-load-test","title":"Specifying Scripts for a load test","text":"<p>To specify the script participating in aScript Load Test: </p> <ol> <li>For every script you want to include in the Script Load test, click Add Script. </li> </ol> <p></p> <p>The Scripts page appears. </p> <p></p> <p>The Scripts page lists the scripts uploaded to the WebLOAD Dashboard.

You recorded a navigation to page.html and then submitted the form on frame1.html. Thus, your Script would appear as follows:</p> <pre><code>Get page.html \n\nGet frame1.html \n\nGet frame2.html \n\nGet frame3.html\n\n Get frame4.html\n\nPost the form from frame1.html\n</code></pre> <p>In order to correlate the data for the final Post, you need the document from frame1. The intervening Get\u2019s, however, will not enable you to get this document. Manually insert the SaveCurrentHiddenFields() method after frame1.html in this example.

For example, if for some reason you absolutely had to assign values to the wlHttp properties in the InitClient() function of the script, change the value of the Erase property to false. If Erase is false, the properties retain their values through subsequent rounds.</p> <p>Thus another way to correct the preceding example is to write:</p> <pre><code>function InitClient() \n\n{            //OK \n\n\n\nwlHttp.Erase = false \n\nwlHttp.Url =[\u201chttp://www.ABCDEF.com/products.exe](http://www.ABCDEF.com/products.exe)\u201d \n\nwlHttp.FormData[\u201cName\u201d] = \u201cJohn Smith\u201d \n\nwlHttp.FormData[\u201cProduct Interest\u201d] = \u201cModems\u201d\n\n}\n\n//Main script wlHttp.Post()\n</code></pre> <p>User-defined properties are not linked to the wlHttp.Erase property and will not be</p> <p>erased automatically by WebLOAD.

WebLOAD submits the field values to the HTTP server when you call the Get(), Post(), or Head() method of the wlHttp object. FormData goes through HTTP encoding before being sent to the server in the same manner as content-type=application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  The collection indices are the field names (HTML name attributes). Before you call wlHttp.Post(), set the value of each element to the data that you want to submit in the HTML field. The fields can be any HTML controls, such as buttons, text areas, or hidden controls.  **Method**  Use the wlClear() (see [*wlClear() (method)* ](#_bookmark440)on page [301](#_bookmark440)) method to delete specific FormData fields or clear all the FormData fields at once.  JavaScript supports two equivalent notations for named collection elements: FormData.FirstName or FormData[\u201cFirstName\u201d]. The latter notation also supports spaces in the name, for example, FormData[\u201cFirst Name\u201d].  ##### Getting FormData using Get()  You can get form data using a Get() call. For example:  `wlHttp.FormData[\u201cFirstName\u201d] = \u201cBill\u201d`  `wlHttp.FormData[\u201cLastName\u201d] = \u201cSmith\u201d`  `wlHttp.FormData[\u201cEmailAddress\u201d] = [\u201cbsmith@ABCDEF.com](mailto:bsmith@ABCDEF.com)\u201d`  `wlHttp.Get(\u201chttp://www.ABCDEF.com/submit.cgi\u201d)`  WebLOAD appends the form data to the URL as a query statement, using the following syntax:  `http://www.ABCDEF.com/submit.cgi`  `?FirstName=Bill&amp;LastName=Smith [&amp;Ema](mailto:&amp;EmailAddress=bsmith@ABCDEF.com)[ilAddress=bsmith@ABCDEF.com](mailto:ilAddress=bsmith@ABCDEF.com)`  ##### Submitting FormData using Post()  Suppose you are testing an HTML form that requires name and email address data. You need to submit the form to the submit.cgi program, which processes the data. You can code this in the following way:   <pre><code>wlHttp.FormData[\u201cFirstName\u201d] = \u201cBill\u201d \n\nwlHttp.FormData[\u201cLastName\u201d] = \u201cSmith\u201d\n\n wlHttp.FormData[\u201cEmailAddress\u201d] = [\u201cbsmith@ABCDEF.com](mailto:bsmith@ABCDEF.com)\u201d \n\nwlHttp.Post(\u201chttp://www.ABCDEF.com/submit.cgi\u201d)\n</code></pre>   The Post() call connects to submit.cgi and sends the FormData fields. In the above example, WebLOAD would post the following fields:  `FirstName=Bil`   `LastName=Smith`  `[EmailAddress=bsmith@ABCDEF.com`](mailto:EmailAddress=bsmith@ABCDEF.com)  You may also submit FormData with missing fields or with data files.  **See also**  * Data (see [*Data (property)* ](#_bookmark80)on page [66](#_bookmark80)) * DataFile (see [*DataFile (property)* ](#_bookmark82)on page [67](#_bookmark82)) * Erase (see [*Erase (property)* ](#_bookmark113)on page [88](#_bookmark113)) * FileName (see [*FileName (property)* ](#_bookmark122)on page [93](#_bookmark122)) * Get() (see [*Get() (transaction method)* ](#_bookmark136)on page [104](#_bookmark136)) * Header (see [*Header (property)* ](#_bookmark195)on page [140](#_bookmark195)) * Post() (see [*Post() (method)* ](#_bookmark290)on page [205](#_bookmark290)) * type (see [*type (property)* ](#_bookmark420)on page [288](#_bookmark420)) * value (see [*value (property)* ](#_bookmark430)on page [294](#_bookmark430)) * wlClear() (see [*wlClear() (method)* ](#_bookmark440)on page [301](#_bookmark440))  ## frames (object)  **Property of Object**  * document (see [*document (object)* ](#_bookmark100)on page [78](#_bookmark100))  **Description**  The frames object retrieves a collection of all window objects defined by the given document or defined by the document associated with the given window. Each window object contains one of the child windows found in a browser window frameset. The frames collection stores the complete parse results for downloaded HTML frames, including nested child windows. Use the frames properties to retrieve information about any child windows to which the current window or document are linked.  frames collections are local to a single thread. WebLOAD creates an independent frames collection for each thread of a script. You cannot create new frames collections using the JavaScript new operator, but you can access HTML frames through the properties and methods of the standard DOM objects. frames properties are read-only.  **Syntax**  The frames collection includes a length property that reports the number of frame objects within a document (read-only). To find out how many window objects are contained within a document, check the value of:  `document.frames.length`  Use an index number to access an individual frame\u2019s properties. Access each window\u2019s properties directly using the following syntax:  `document.frames[#].&lt;*child-property*&gt;`  You can also access a member of the frames collection by its HTML name attribute. For example:  `document.frames[\u201cnamestring\u201d]`  -Or-  document.frames.namestring  If the GetFrames property is false, the frames collection is empty.  **Example**  Access each window\u2019s properties directly through an index number:  `document.frames[1].location`  Access the first child window using the following expression:  ``frames[0]``  Access the first child window\u2019s link objects directly using the following syntax:  `frames[0]`.`frames[0]`.links[#].&lt;*property*&gt;  For example:  ``document.`frames[0]``.links[0].protocol`  **Properties**  * id (see [*id (property)* ](#_bookmark208)on page [146](#_bookmark208)) * Index (see [*Index (property)* ](#_bookmark214)on page [152](#_bookmark214)) * Name (see [*Name (property)* ](#_bookmark253)on page [174](#_bookmark253)) * title (see [*title (property)* ](#_bookmark415)on page [284](#_bookmark415)) * Url (see [*Url (property)* ](#_bookmark422)on page [289](#_bookmark422))  **See also**  * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)) * GetFrames (see [*GetFrames (property)* ](#_bookmark153)on page [117](#_bookmark153))  ## Function (property)  **Property of Object**  * wlVerification (see [*wlVerification (object)* ](#_bookmark497)on page [337](#_bookmark497))  **Description**  Function is used to define a global JavaScript function called when a verification fail error occurs. When defined, Function affects all the verifications in which a JavaScript function is not defined. If you define a JavaScript function for a specific verification, it overrides the global JavaScript function defined in the Function property.  **Example**  To set the global JavaScript function called in the event of any verification fail errors to  `GetOperatingSystem(), write:`  `wlVerification.Function = GetOperatingSystem()`  **See also**  * wlVerification (see [*wlVerification (object)* ](#_bookmark497)on page [337](#_bookmark497)) * PageContentLength (see [*PageContentLength (property)* ](#_bookmark270)on page [189](#_bookmark270)) * PageTime (see [*PageTime (property)* ](#_bookmark271)on page [190](#_bookmark271)) * Severity (see [*Severity (property)* ](#_bookmark360)on page [247](#_bookmark360)) * ErrorMessage (see [*ErrorMessage (property)* ](#_bookmark116)on page [91](#_bookmark116)) * Title (see [*Title (function)* ](#_bookmark417)on page [285](#_bookmark417))  ## GeneratorName() (function)  **Description**  GeneratorName() provides a unique identification for the current Load Generator instance, even with multiple spawned processes running simultaneously. The identification string is composed of a combination of the current Load Generator name, computer name, and other internal markers.  **Syntax**  GeneratorName()  **Return Value**  Returns a unique identification string for the current Load Generator.  **GUI mode**  WebLOAD recommends accessing global system variables, including the GeneratorName() identification function through the WebLOAD Recorder. All the variables that appear in this list are available for use at all times in a script file. In the WebLOAD Recorder main window, click **Variables Windows** in the **Debug** tab of the ribbon**.**  For example, it is convenient to add GeneratorName() to a Message Node to clarify which Load Generator sent the messages that appear in the WebLOAD Console Log window.  **See also**  * ClientNum (see [*ClientNum (variable)* ](#_bookmark60)on page [50](#_bookmark60)) * GetOperatingSystem() (see [*GetOperatingSystem() (function)* ](#_bookmark176)on page [131](#_bookmark176)) * [*Identification Variables and Functions* ](#_bookmark28)(on page [29](#_bookmark28)) * RoundNum (see [*RoundNum (variable)* ](#_bookmark314)on page [222](#_bookmark314)) * VCUniqueID() (see [*VCUniqueID() (function)* ](#_bookmark432)on page [296](#_bookmark432))  ## Get() (method)  ### Get() (addition method)  **Method of Objects**  * wlGeneratorGlobal (see [*w*](#_bookmark450)[*lGeneratorGlobal (object)* ](#_bookmark450)on page [309](#_bookmark450)) * wlSystemGlobal (see [*wlSystemGlobal (object)* ](#_bookmark491)on page [332](#_bookmark490))  **Description**  Returns the current value of the specified shared variable.  **Syntax**  `Get(\u201cSharedVarName\u201d, ScopeFlag)`  **Parameters**  | **Parameter Name** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | SharedVarName            | The name of a shared variable whose value should  be returned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | | ScopeFlag                | One of two flags, WLCurrentAgenda or WLAllAgendas, signifying the scope of  the shared variable.

You may optionally specify  the URL as a parameter of the method. Get() connects to the first URL that has been specified  from the following list, in the order specified:``A Url parameter  specified in the method call.  ``The Url property of  the wlHttp object.  ``The local default wlLocals.Url.  ``The global default wlGlobals.Url.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | | [TransName]              | An optional user-supplied  string with the transaction name as it will appear in the Statistics Report.  Use*named transactions* to identify specific HTTP transactions by  name. This simplifies assigning counters when you want WebLOAD to  automatically calculate a specific transaction\u2019s occurrence, success, and  failure rates.  The run-time statistics  for transactions to which you have assigned a name appear in the Statistics  Report. For your convenience, WebLOAD offers an Automatic Transaction option.  In the WebLOAD Console, select Automatic Transaction from the General Tab of  the Global Options dialog box. Automatic Transaction is set to true by default. With Automatic Transaction,  WebLOAD automatically assigns a name to every Get and Post HTTP transaction.  This makes statistical analysis simpler, since all HTTP transaction activity  is measured, recorded, and reported for you automatically. You do not have to  remember to add naming instructions to each Get and Post command in your script. The name assigned by  WebLOAD is simply the URL used by that Get or Post transaction. If your  script includes multiple transactions to the same URL, the information will  be collected cumulatively for those transactions. |  **Example**   <pre><code>function InitAgenda() {\n\n//Set the default URL\n\nwlGlobals.Url = [\u201chttp://www.ABCDEF.com](http://www.ABCDEF.com/)\u201d\n\n}\n\n//Main script\n\n//Connect to the default URL: wlHttp.Get()\n\n//Connect to a different, explicitly set URL: [wlHttp.Get(\u201chttp://www.ABCDEF.com/product_info.html](http://www.ABCDEF.com/product_info.html)\u201d)\n\n//Assign a name to the following HTTP transaction: url= [http://www.ABCDEF.com/product_info.html](http://www.abcdef.com/product_info.html) wlHttp.Get(url,\n\n\u201cUpdateBankAccount\u201d)\n\nUse named transactions as a shortcut in place of the BeginTransaction()...EndTransaction() module. For example, this is one way to identify a logical transaction unit:\n\nBeginTransaction(\u201cUpdateBankAccount\u201d) wlHttp.Get(url)\n\n// the body of the transaction\n\n// any valid JavaScript statements wlHttp.Post(url);\n\nEndTransaction(\u201cUpdateBankAccount\u201d)\n\n// and so on\n\nUsing the named transaction syntax, you could write:\n\nwlHttp.Get(url,\u201dUpdateBankAccount\u201d)\n\n// the body of the transaction\n\n// any valid JavaScript statements wlHttp.Post(url,\u201dUpdateBankAccount\u201d)\n\n// and so on\n\nFor the HTTPS protocol, include \u201chttps://\u201d in the URL and set the required properties of the wlGlobals object:\n\n[wlHttp.Get(\u201chttps://www.ABCDEF.com](http://www.ABCDEF.com/)\u201d)\n</code></pre>   **Comment**  You may not use the TransName parameter by itself.

Omit the optional frame parameter if the HTML page does not contain frames.  ## GetFrameByUrl() (method)  **Method of Object**  * wlHtml (see [*wlHtml (object)* ](#_bookmark464)on page [315](#_bookmark463))  **Description**  Retrieve a frame object given its URL.  **Syntax**  `GetFrameByUrl(UrlPattern [, frame])`  **Parameters**  | **Parameter  Name** | **Description**                                                                        | | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | UrlPattern                | The URL for the frame requested.                                                             | | [frame]                   | An optional frame  specification, used to limit the scope of the search to a specific frame. |  **Return Value**  The requested frame.  **Example**   <pre><code>//Retrieve Frame0\n\nFrame0 = wlHtml.GetFrame[ByUrl(\u201chttp://MyCompany/Frame0.html](http://MyCompany/Frame0.html)\u201d)\n\n//Retrieve Frame0.1\n\nFrame0_1 = wlHtml.GetFrameByUrl([\u201chttp://MyCompany/Frame0B.html](http://MyCompany/Frame0B.html)\u201d)\n\nYou may use * as a wildcard character in the URL. The method returns the first frame matching the search pattern. For example:\n\n// To match URL [(http://MyCompany/Frame0B.html)](http://MyCompany/Frame0B.html)) Frame0_1 = wlHtml.GetFrameByUrl(\u201c*B.htm*\u201d)\n\nYou may narrow the search to frames nested within a specific parent frame by\n\nspecifying the optional frame parameter. For example:\n\n//Search within Frame0 and retrieve Frame0.0\n\nFrame0_0 = wlHtml.GetFrameByUrl(\u201c*/MyCompany/*\u201d,Frame0)\n</code></pre>   **Comment**  By default, the method searches in all frames of the parse tree and returns the first match. You may narrow the search by specifying an optional frame parameter. In that case, the method searches within the specified frame and all its nested frames.  Comment out `GetFrames=false` when you use the GetFrameByUrl method.  ## GetFrames (property)  **Property of Object**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  **Description**  Enables the retrieval of Frames and IFrames in an HTML page. The default value of GetFrames is **true**.  **Note:** This property can only be inserted manually.   Although the default value for GetFrames is true, during recording, the following is automatically inserted in the script: wlGlobals.`GetFrames=false`;  **Example**  wlGlobals.GetFrames = true  **Comments**  When GetMetas is true, GetFrames should also be true as the redirection is retrieved as a frame (see [*GetMetas (property)* ](#_bookmark174)on page [130](#_bookmark174)).  **See also**  * GetApplets() (see [*GetApplets (property)* ](#_bookmark137)on page [107](#_bookmark137)) * GetCss() (see [*GetCss (property)* ](#_bookmark138)on page [108](#_bookmark138)) * GetEmbeds() (see [*GetEmbeds (property)* ](#_bookmark145)on page [113](#_bookmark145)) * GetImages() (see [*GetImages (property)* ](#_bookmark162)on page [121](#_bookmark162)) * GetOthers() (see [*GetOthers (property)* ](#_bookmark177)on page [131](#_bookmark177)) * GetScripts() (see [*GetScripts (property)* ](#_bookmark183)on page [134](#_bookmark183)) * GetXml() (see [*GetXml() (property)* ](#_bookmark191)on page [138](#_bookmark191))  ## GetFrameUrl() (method)  **Method of Object**  * wlHtml (see [*wlHtml (object)* ](#_bookmark464)on page [315](#_bookmark463))  **Description**  Retrieve a location object representing the URL of an HTML page. Optionally, specify a nested frame.  **Syntax**  `GetFrameUrl([frame])`  **Comment**  Comment out `GetFrames=false` when you use the GetFrameByUrl method.  **Return Value**  The requested location object.  **Comment**  This method is equivalent to the location property of a frame object (see [*frames (object)](#_bookmark129)  on page [99](#_bookmark129)).  ## GetHeaderValue() (method)  **Method of Object**  * wlHtml (see [*wlHtml (object)* ](#_bookmark464)on page [315](#_bookmark463))  **Description**  Retrieve the value of an HTTP header field.  **Syntax**  GetHeaderValue(HeaderName [, frame])  **Parameters**  | **Parameter  Name** | **Description**                                                                        | | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | HeaderName                | The name of the header whose value is to be  retrieved.                                      | | [frame]                   | An optional frame  specification, used to limit the scope of the search to a specific frame. |  **Return Value**  The requested HTTP header field value.  `wlHtml.GetHeaderValue(\u201cHost\u201d) returns \u201cServer2.MyCompany.com\u201d.`  -Or-  `document.wlHeaders[\u201chost\u201d] document.frame[0].wlHeaders[\u201chost\u201d]`  **Comment**  By default, the method searches in all frames of the parse tree and returns the first match. You may narrow the search by specifying an optional frame parameter. In that case, the method searches within the specified frame and all its nested frames.  If you are specifying a frame, comment out `GetFrames=false`.  ## GetHost() (method)  **Method of Object**  * wlHtml (see [*wlHtml (object)* ](#_bookmark464)on page [315](#_bookmark463))  **Description**  Retrieve the host of a URL, including the port number.  **Syntax**  GetHost([frame])  **Parameters**  | **Parameter Name** | **Description**                                                                        | | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | [frame]                  | An optional frame  specification, used to limit the scope of the search to a specific frame. |  **Return Value**  The requested host information.  **Example**  For the following HTTP Header example:  `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`  `Server: Netscape-Enterprise/3.0F Date: Sun, 11 Jan 1998 08:25:20 GMT`  `Content-type: text/html Connection: close`  `Host: Server2.MyCompany.com:80 wlHtml.GetHost()`  `returns \u201cServer2.MyCompany.com:80\u201d.`  -Or-  `document.wlHeaders[\u201chostname\u201d] document.frame[0].wlHeaders[\u201chostname\u201d]`  **Comment**  By default, the method searches in all frames of the parse tree and returns the first match. You may narrow the search by specifying an optional frame parameter. In that case, the method searches within the specified frame and all its nested frames.  If you are specifying a frame, comment out `GetFrames=false`.  ## GetHostName() (method)  **Method of Object**  * wlHtml (see [*wlHtml (object)* ](#_bookmark464)on page [315](#_bookmark463))  **Description**  Retrieve the host name of a URL, not including the port number.  **Syntax**  `GetHostName([frame])`  **Return Value**  The requested host name.  `wlHtml.GetHostName()`  `returns \u201cServer2.MyCompany.com\u201d.`  **Comment**  By default, the method searches in all frames of the parse tree and returns the first match. You may narrow the search by specifying an optional frame parameter. In that case, the method searches within the specified frame and all its nested frames.  If you are specifying a frame, comment out `GetFrames=false`.  ## GetImages (property)  **Property of Object**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  **Description**  Enables the retrieval of images in an HTML page. The default value of GetImages is true.  When GetImages is false, the load engine does not retrieve the images from an HTML page.  &gt; **Note:** This property can only be inserted manually.  **Example**  `wlGlobals.GetImages = true`  **See also**  * GetApplets() (see [*GetApplets (property)* ](#_bookmark137)on page [107](#_bookmark137)) * GetCss() (see [*GetCss (property)* ](#_bookmark138)on page [108](#_bookmark138)) * GetEmbeds() (see [*GetEmbeds (property)* ](#_bookmark145)on page [113](#_bookmark145)) * GetFrames() (see [*GetFrames (property)* ](#_bookmark153)on page [117](#_bookmark153)) * GetOthers() (see [*GetOthers (property)* ](#_bookmark177)on page [131](#_bookmark177)) * GetScripts() (see [*GetScripts (property)* ](#_bookmark183)on page [134](#_bookmark183)) * GetXml() (see [*GetXml() (property)* ](#_bookmark191)on page [138](#_bookmark191))  ## GetImagesInThinClient (property)  **Properties of Objects**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  **Description**  When set to true, the \u201cThin\u201d client will retrieve images. The default value of GetImagesInThinClient is **false**.  &gt; **Note:** This property can only be inserted manually.  **Example**  wlGlobals.GetImagesInThinClient = true  **See also**  * SetClientType (see [*SetClientType (function)* ](#_bookmark352)on page [242](#_bookmark352)) * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)) * document (see [*document (object)* ](#_bookmark100)on page [78](#_bookmark100)) * Header (see [*Header (property)* ](#_bookmark195)on page [140](#_bookmark195)) * wlSearchPairs (see [*wlSearchPairs (object)* ](#_bookmark480)on page [327](#_bookmark481))  ## GetIPAddress() (method)  **Method of Objects**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  **Description**  Returns the identity of the *current* IP address.  **Syntax**  `GetIPAddress()`  **Return Value**  Returns a string with the IP address for the current Virtual Client.  **Example**  ...  `wlHttp.MultiIPSupport = true CurrentIPAddress = wlHttp.GetIPAddress() wlHttp.Get()`  ...  **Comment**  Requesting the identity of the *current* IP address is only meaningful if your script is handling more than one IP address. GetIPAddress() therefore can only return a value if MultiIPSupport=true. If MultiIPSupport is turned off this method will return \u201cUndefined\u201d.  The scope of MultiIPSupport depends, of course, on whether it was set through wlGlobals, wlLocals, or wlHttp. For example, if your script sets wlGlobals.MultiIPSupport, then GetIPAddress() returns a value at any point in the script. If you set only wlHttp.MultiIPSupport, then GetIPAddress()returns a value only if called before the next immediate HTTP transaction.  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21))  ## GetLine() (function)  **Description**  The GetLine() function reads and parses data from an ASCII file. The function reads the file one line at a time in the following way:  * If you opened the file using the default sequential mode (see [*Open() (function)* ](#_bookmark262)on page [183](#_bookmark262)), then: * The first GetLine() call in any thread of a Load Generator reads the first line of the file. * Each successive call in any thread of any process of the Load Generator (across the master and slave processes of a single Load Generator/script combination) reads the next line of the file. * When the last line of the file has been read, the next access loops back to the first line of the file. * If you opened the file for random access (see [*Open() (function)* ](#_bookmark262)on page [183](#_bookmark262)), each successive call in any thread of any process of the Load Generator (across the master and slave processes of a single Load Generator/script combination) reads some randomly selected line of the file. To read the input file lines in random order, you must include Open(filename, WLRandom) in the script\u2019s InitAgenda() function.  In this way, a relatively small file can supply an unending stream of test data, and different clients are supplied with different sequences of data.  &gt; **Note:** The last line of the file should not include a carriage return.  **Syntax**  GetLine(filename[, delimiter])  **Parameters**  | **Parameter  Name** | **Description**                                                                                        | | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | filename                  | A string with the name of  the file being read. May optionally include the full directory path.              | | [delimiter]               | Optional character separating fields in one  line of the input file. Default delimiter character is a comma. |  **Return Value**  The GetLine function returns an array containing both the full lines and the individual tokens. The array (called LineArray in this example) includes the following elements:  * LineArray[0]-the complete line. For example: \u201cJohn,Smith, [jsmith@ABC.com](mailto:jsmith@ABC.com)\u201d * LineArray[1]-the first token. In this example:\u201cJohn\u201d * LineArray[2]-the second token. In this example:\u201cSmith\u201d * LineArray[3]-the third token. In this example:[\u201cjsmith@ABC.com](mailto:jsmith@ABC.com)\u201d * LineArray.RoundNum-number of rounds through the file (including the current round). For example: 4 * LineArray.LineNum-the number of the line that was just read. For example: 1  **Example**  To read and parse the next line of the mydata.txt ASCII input file, in this case including a directory path:  `LineArray = GetLine(\u201cc:\\\\temp\\\\mydata.txt\u201d)`  To specify a different delimiter:  `LineArray = GetLine(\u201cc:\\\\temp\\\\mydata.txt\u201d, \u201c:\u201d)`  **Comment**  JavaScript requires that you double the backslash in strings. If your directory path includes the backslash character, remember to double the backslashes, as in the preceding example.  If the line found in the file contains no separator characters, then the entire line is considered to be a single token. In that case, the function returns a two-element array (LineArray[0] and LineArray[1]), each containing the entire line.  **See also**  * Close() (see [*Close() (function)* ](#_bookmark61)on page [52](#_bookmark61)) * CopyFile() (see [*CopyFile() (function)* ](#_bookmark76)on page [61](#_bookmark76)) * [*File Management Functions* ](#_bookmark25)(on page [*28*](#_bookmark25)) * IncludeFile() (see [*IncludeFile() (function)* ](#_bookmark212)on page [150](#_bookmark212)) * Open() (see [*Open() (function)* ](#_bookmark261)on page [183](#_bookmark261)) * Reset() (see [*Reset() (method)* ](#_bookmark310)on page [220](#_bookmark310)) * [*Using the IntelliSense JavaScript Editor* ](#_bookmark18)(on page [18](#_bookmark18)) * wlOutputFile (see [*wlOutputFile() (constructor)* ](#_bookmark477)on page [324](#_bookmark477)) * wlOutputFile() (see [*wlOutputFile (object)* ](#_bookmark474)on page [323](#_bookmark474)) * Write() (see [*Write() (method)* ](#_bookmark504)on page [343](#_bookmark504)) * Writeln() (see [*Writeln() (method)* ](#_bookmark506)on page [344](#_bookmark506))  ## GetLine() (method)  **Method of Object**  * wlInputFile (see [*wlInputFile (object)* ](#_bookmark467)on page [317](#_bookmark467))  **Description**  The GetLine() function reads and parses data from an ASCII file. The function reads the file one line at a time in the following way:  * If you opened the file using the default WLFileSequential access method (see [*Open() (method)* ](#_bookmark260)on page [180](#_bookmark260)), then: * The first GetLine() call in any thread of a Load Generator reads the first line of the file. * Each successive call in any thread of any process of any Load Generator reads the next line of the file. * When the last line of the file has been read, the next access loops back to the first line of the file. * If you opened the file using the WLFileSequentialUnique access method (see[ *Open() (method)* ](#_bookmark260)on page [180](#_bookmark260)), then the procedure is basically as when using the WLFileSequential access mode, except that the if the value/row is being used by another VC, it is not retrieved, but skipped. * If you opened the file using the WLFileRandom access method (see [*Open() (method)*](#_bookmark260) on page [180](#_bookmark260)), GetLine() reads a random value/row from the file, where there might be multiple access to the same line by different Load Generator machines. * If you opened the file using the WLFileRandomUnique access method (see [*Open()*](#_bookmark260)[ *(method)* ](#_bookmark260)on page [180](#_bookmark260)), GetLine() reads a unique, unused value/row randomly from the file.  &gt; **Note:** The last line of the file should not include a carriage return.  **Syntax**  `strInputFileLine = myFileObj.getLine(*delimiter*)`  **Parameters**  | **Parameter  Name** | **Description**                                                                                        | | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | delimiter                 | Optional character separating fields in one  line of the input file. Default delimiter character is a comma. |  **Return Value**  The GetLine function returns an array containing both the full lines and the individual tokens. The array (called strInputFileLine in this example) includes the following elements:  * strInputFileLine [0]-the complete line. For example:\u201cJohn,Smith, [jsmith@ABC.com](mailto:jsmith@ABC.com)\u201d * strInputFileLine [1]-the first token. In this example:\u201cJohn\u201d * strInputFileLine [2]-the second token. In this example:\u201cSmith\u201d * strInputFileLine [3]-the third token. In this example:[\u201cjsmith@ABC.com](mailto:jsmith@ABC.com)\u201d * strInputFileLine.LineNum-the number of the line that was just read. For example: 1  **Example**  To read and parse the next line of the ASCII input file specified in myFileObj:  `strInputFileLine = GetLine(\u201c,\u201d)`  **Comment**  If the line found in the file contains no separator characters, then the entire line is considered to be a single token. In that case, the function returns a two-element array (strInputFileLine[0] and strInputFileLine[1]), each containing the entire line.  **See also**  * [*File Management Functions* ](#_bookmark25)(on page [*28*](#_bookmark25)) * [*Using the IntelliSense JavaScript Editor* ](#_bookmark18)(on page [18](#_bookmark18)) * wlInputFile (see [*wlInputFile() (constructor)* ](#_bookmark468)on page [318](#_bookmark468))  ## GetLinkByName() (method)  **Method of Object**  * wlHtml (see [*wlHtml (object)* ](#_bookmark464)on page [315](#_bookmark463))  **Description**  Retrieve a location object representing a link, given the hypertext display.  **Syntax**  `GetLinkByName(Hypertext [, frame])`  **Parameters**  | **Parameter  Name** | **Description**                                                                        | | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Hypertext                 | The hypertext displayed in the desired  link.                                                | | [frame]                   | An optional frame  specification, used to limit the scope of the search to a specific frame. |  **Return Value**  The requested location object.  **Example**  Suppose the HTML on a page contains:  `Product information `  In this example,  `wlHtml.GetLinkByName(\u201cProduct information\u201d)`  returns a location object for [http://MyCompany/link1.html.](http://MyCompany/link1.html)  The search is case sensitive. You may use the * wildcard character in the Hypertext string. For example, wlHtml.GetLinkByName(\u201c*roduct info*\u201d) also returns an object for [http://MyCompany/link1.html.](http://MyCompany/link1.html)  **Comment**  By default, the method searches in all frames of the parse tree and returns the first match. You may narrow the search by specifying an optional frame parameter. In that case, the method searches within the specified frame and all its nested frames.  If you are specifying a frame, comment out `GetFrames=false`.  ## GetLinkByUrl() (method)  **Method of Object**  * wlHtml (see [*wlHtml (object)* ](#_bookmark464)on page [315](#_bookmark463))  **Description**  Retrieve a location object representing a link, given part of the URL string.  **Syntax**  `GetLinkByUrl(UrlPattern [, frame])`  **Parameters**  | **Parameter  Name** | **Description**                                                                        | | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | UrlPattern                | The URL of the desired link. Use the *  wildcard character to represent the missing parts.   | | [frame]                   | An optional frame  specification, used to limit the scope of the search to a specific frame. |  **Return Value**  The requested location object.  **Example**  Suppose the HTML on a page contains:  Product information ``  In this example,  `wlHtml.GetLinkByUrl(\u201c*link1.htm*\u201d)`  returns a location object for [http://MyCompany/link1.html.](http://MyCompany/link1.html)  **Comment**  By default, the method searches in all frames of the parse tree and returns the first match. You may narrow the search by specifying an optional frame parameter. In that case, the method searches within the specified frame and all its nested frames.  If you are specifying a frame, comment out `GetFrames=false`.  ## GetMessage() (method)  **Method of Object**  * wlException (see [*wlException (object)* ](#_bookmark447)on page [306](#_bookmark446))  **Description**  Returns the message string text stored in this object.  **Syntax**  `*wlExceptionObject*.GetMessage()`  **Return Value**  Text string of the error message for this object.  **Example**  `MeaningfulErrorMessage = myExceptionObject.GetMessage()`  **See also**  * ErrorMessage() (see [*ErrorMessage() (function)* ](#_bookmark115)on page [90](#_bookmark115)) * GetSeverity() (see [*GetSeverity() (method)* ](#_bookmark182)on page [134](#_bookmark182)) * InfoMessage() (see [*InfoMessage() (function)* ](#_bookmark217)on page [153](#_bookmark217)) * [*Message Functions* ](#_bookmark29)(on page [30](#_bookmark29)) * ReportLog() (see [*ReportLog() (method)* ](#_bookmark308)on page [219](#_bookmark308)) * SevereErrorMessage() (see [*SevereErrorMessage() (function)* ](#_bookmark359)on page [246](#_bookmark359)) * [*Using the IntelliSense JavaScript Editor* ](#_bookmark18)(on page [18](#_bookmark18)) * WarningMessage() (see [*WarningMessage() (function)* ](#_bookmark437)on page [299](#_bookmark437)) * wlException (see [*wlException (object)* ](#_bookmark446)on page [306](#_bookmark446))  ## GetMetas (property)  **Property of Object**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * wlHttp (see [*wlHttp (object)* ](#_bookmark465)on page [316](#_bookmark465))  **Description**  The GetMetas property, when set to true, enables the support of redirection for non-recorded scripts, for websites using the HTML META tag (for example, www.ynet.co.il).  &gt; **Note:** Since scripts that were recorded automatically include the redirected URL, the GetMetas property should be used only in scripts that were written manually and that contain a URL with meta direction.  **Example**  `wlGlobals.GetMetas = false`  **Comments**  * Because the redirection is retrieved as a frame, the GetFrames property must be set to true (see [*GetFrames (property)* ](#_bookmark153)on page [117](#_bookmark153)). * The additional wlHttp.GET will not be part of the script (it will be like frame 0). * The desired page will be requested only on playback. * The page will not be visible in WebLOAD Recorder\u2019s Browser View. This is because redirection will not be performed (the document will not be replaced). WebLOAD implements the redirected URL by adding a frame to the parent HTML. That is, the first page will be added with an extra frame containing the redirection URL (fully parsed and all the objects in it will be get).  ## GetOperatingSystem() (function)  **Description**  Returns a string identifying the operating system running on the current Load Generator.  **Syntax**  GetOperatingSystem()  **Return Value**  Returns the name of the operating system running on the current Load Generator in  the format of the operating system name followed by some version identification.  For example, if the Load Generator is working with a Solaris platform, this function would return the string \u2018Solaris\u2019 followed by the version name and release number, such as SunOS2.  If the Load Generator is working with a Linux platform, this function would return the string \u2018Linux\u2019 followed by the version name and release number, such as RedHat1.  If the Load Generator is working with a Windows platform, possible return values include:  * Windows 95 * Windows 98 * Windows NT/2000 (*ServicePack#*) * Windows XP * Windows (for any other Windows version)  **See also**  * ClientNum (see [*ClientNum (variable)* ](#_bookmark60)on page [50](#_bookmark60)) * GeneratorName() (see [*GeneratorName() (function)* ](#_bookmark131)on page [101](#_bookmark131)) * [*Identification Variables and Functions* ](#_bookmark28)(on page [29](#_bookmark28)) * RoundNum (see [*RoundNum (variable)* ](#_bookmark314)on page [222](#_bookmark314)) * VCUniqueID() (see [*VCUniqueID() (function)* ](#_bookmark432)on page [296](#_bookmark432))  ## GetOthers (property)  **Property of Object**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  **Description**  Enables the retrieval of objects not covered by the other Get methods in an HTML page.

You may narrow the search by specifying an optional frame parameter. In that case, the method searches within the specified frame and all its nested frames.  If you are specifying a frame, comment out `GetFrames=false`.  ## GetQSFieldValue() (method)  **Method of Object**  * wlHtml (see [*wlHtml (object)* ](#_bookmark464)on page [315](#_bookmark463))  **Description**  Retrieve the value of a search attribute in a URL. The search attributes are the fields following the ? symbol, appended to the end of a URL.  **Syntax**  `GetQSFieldValue(Url, FieldName)`  **Parameters**  | **Parameter  Name** | **Description**                                  | | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | | Url                       | The complete URL string to be parsed and  searched.    | | FieldName                 | The name of the field whose value is to be  retrieved. |  **Return Value**  The requested value.  **Example**  The following search string:  `wlHtml.GetQSFieldValue([\u201chttp://www.ABCDEF.com/query.exe](http://www.ABCDEF.com/query.exe)\u201d + \u201c?SearchFor=icebergs&amp;SearchType=ExactTerm\u201d,\u201dSearchFor\u201d)`  returns \u201cicebergs\u201d.  ## GetScripts (property)  **Property of Object**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  **Description**  Enables the retrieval of external JavaScript scripts in an HTML page.

The default value of GetXML is **true**.  &gt; **Note:** This property can only be inserted manually.  **Example**  wlGlobals.GetXML = true  **See also**  * GetApplets() (see [*GetApplets (property)* ](#_bookmark137)on page [107](#_bookmark137)) * GetCss() (see [*GetCss (property)* ](#_bookmark138)on page [108](#_bookmark138)) * GetEmbeds() (see [*GetEmbeds (property)* ](#_bookmark145)on page [113](#_bookmark145)) * GetFrames() (see [*GetFrames (property)* ](#_bookmark153)on page [117](#_bookmark153)) * GetImages() (see [*GetImages (property)* ](#_bookmark162)on page [121](#_bookmark162)) * GetOthers() (see [*GetOthers (property)* ](#_bookmark177)on page [131](#_bookmark177)) * GetScripts() (see [*GetScripts (property)* ](#_bookmark183)on page [134](#_bookmark183))  ## hash (property)  **Property of Object**  * link (see [*link (object)* ](#_bookmark235)on page [162](#_bookmark235)) * location (see [*location (object)* ](#_bookmark243)on page [168](#_bookmark243))  **Description**  The HTML anchor portion of the URL, not including the # initial symbol (read-only string).  **Example**  Given the following HTML fragment:  ``  `[&lt;A ](\u201chttps://www.ABCDEF.com:80/products/order.html#modems\u201d)[href=\u201chttp://www.ABCDEF.com/search.exe?](http://www.ABCDEF.com/search.exe)`  `SearchFor=modems&amp;SearchType=ExactTerm\u201d&gt;`  links[0].hash is \u201cmodems\u201d.  ## Head() (method)  **Method of Object**  * wlHttp (see [*wlHttp (object)* ](#_bookmark465)on page [316](#_bookmark465))  **Description**  Perform an HTTP or HTTPS Head command.  **Syntax**  Head()  **Comment**  This method operates in the same way as Get(), but it retrieves only the HTTP or  HTTPS header from the server. It does not download the body of the URL, such as a Web page.  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * Data (see [*Data (property)* ](#_bookmark80)on page [66](#_bookmark80)) * DataFile (see [*DataFile (property)* ](#_bookmark82)on page [67](#_bookmark82)) * FormData (see [*FormData (property)* ](#_bookmark127)on page [97](#_bookmark127)) * Get() (see [*Get() (transaction method)* ](#_bookmark136)on page [104](#_bookmark136)) * Post() (see [*Post() (method)* ](#_bookmark289)on page [205](#_bookmark289)) * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  ## Header (property)  **Property of Object**  * wlHttp (see [*wlHttp (object)* ](#_bookmark465)on page [316](#_bookmark465))  **Description**  A collection of HTTP header fields that you want to send in a Get(), Post(), or Head() call.  **Example**  By default, WebLOAD sends the following header in any HTTP command:  `host: `  `user-agent: Radview/HttpLoader 1.0 accept: */`*  Here, `` is the host name to which you are connecting, for example:  `www.ABCDEF.com:81.`  You may reset these properties, for example, as follows:  `wlHttp.UserAgent = \u201cMozilla/4.03 [en] (WinNT; I)\u201d`  Alternatively, you can use the Header property to override one of the default header fields. For example, you can redefine the following header field:  `wlHttp.Header[\u201cuser-agent\u201d] = \u201cMozilla/4.03 [en] (WinNT; I)\u201d`  **GUI mode**  WebLOAD offers a simple way to reset configuration properties using the various tabs of the **Default Options** dialog box, accessed from the **Tools** tab of the ribbon. Resetting configuration properties as you run and rerun various testing scenarios enables you to fine tune your tests to match your exact needs at that moment. For example, you can reset the user-agent value through the Browser Parameters tab.  **Comment**  Use the wlClear() (see [*wlClear() (method)* ](#_bookmark440)on page [301](#_bookmark440)) method to delete specific Header fields or clear all the Header fields at once.  You cannot override the host header or set a cookie header using the Header property. To set a cookie, see wlCookie (see [*wlCookie (object)* ](#_bookmark442)on page [302](#_bookmark442))  Use the wlHttp.Header property to change or reset specific individual values immediately before executing the next wlHttp GET/POST request.  Any information set using the wlHttp.Header property *takes priority* over any defaults set through the GUI (recommended) or using the wlGlobals, wlLocals, or wlHttp properties. If there is any discrepancy between the document header information and the HTTP values, WebLOAD will work with the information found in the wlHttp.Header property while also issuing a warning to the user.  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * Data (see [*Data (property)* ](#_bookmark80)on page [66](#_bookmark80)) * DataFile (see [*DataFile (property)* ](#_bookmark82)on page [67](#_bookmark82)) * Erase (see [*Erase (property)* ](#_bookmark113)on page [88](#_bookmark113)) * FileName (see [*FileName (property)* ](#_bookmark122)on page [93](#_bookmark122)) * FormData (see [*FormData (property)* ](#_bookmark127)on page [97](#_bookmark127)) * Get() (see [*Get() (transaction method)* ](#_bookmark136)on page [104](#_bookmark136)) * Post() (see [*Post() (method)* ](#_bookmark290)on page [205](#_bookmark290)) * type (see [*type (property)* ](#_bookmark420)on page [288](#_bookmark420)) * UserAgent (see [*UserAgent (property)* ](#_bookmark425)on page [291](#_bookmark425)) * value (see [*value (property)* ](#_bookmark430)on page [294](#_bookmark430)) * wlClear() (see [*wlClear() (method)* ](#_bookmark440)on page [301](#_bookmark440)) * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  ## host (property)  **Property of Object**  * link (see [*link (object)* ](#_bookmark235)on page [162](#_bookmark235)) * location (see [*location (object)* ](#_bookmark243)on page [168](#_bookmark243))  **Description**  The host portion of the URL, including both the host name and the port (read-only string).  **Example**  Given the following HTML fragment:  ``  `[&lt;A ](\u201chttps://www.ABCDEF.com:80/products/order.html#modems\u201d)[href=\u201chttp://www.ABCDEF.com/search.exe?](http://www.ABCDEF.com/search.exe)`  `SearchFor=modems&amp;SearchType=ExactTerm\u201d&gt;`  links[0].host is \u201cwww.ABCDEF.com:80\u201d  ## hostname (property)  **Property of Object**  * link (see [*link (object)* ](#_bookmark235)on page [162](#_bookmark235)) * location (see [*location (object)* ](#_bookmark243)on page [168](#_bookmark243))  **Description**  The host name portion of the URL (read-only string).  **Example**  Given the following HTML fragment:  ``  `[&lt;A ](\u201chttps://www.ABCDEF.com:80/products/order.html#modems\u201d)[href=\u201chttp://www.ABCDEF.com/search.exe?](http://www.ABCDEF.com/search.exe)`  `SearchFor=modems&amp;SearchType=ExactTerm\u201d&gt;`  links[0].hostname is [\u201cwww.ABCDEF.com](http://www.ABCDEF.com/)\u201d  ## href (property)  **Property of Object**  * link (see [*link (object)* ](#_bookmark235)on page [162](#_bookmark235)) * location (see [*location (object)* ](#_bookmark243)on page [168](#_bookmark243))  **Description**  The complete URL of the link (read-only string).  **Example**  Given the following HTML fragment:  ``  `[&lt;A ](\u201chttps://www.ABCDEF.com:80/products/order.html#modems\u201d)[href=\u201chttp://www.ABCDEF.com/search.exe?](http://www.ABCDEF.com/search.exe)`  `SearchFor=modems&amp;SearchType=ExactTerm\u201d&gt;`  links[0].href is  [\u201chttps://www.ABCDEF.com/products/order.html#modems](http://www.ABCDEF.com/products/order.html#modems)\u201d  **Comment**  The href property contains the entire URL. The other link properties contain portions of the URL. links[#].href is the default property for the link object. For example, if  `[links[0\\]=\u2018http://microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com/)\u2019`  then the following two URL specifications are equivalent:  `mylink=links[0].href`  and  mylink=links[0]  ## HttpCacheScope (property)  **Property of Object**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  **Description**  Defines when the Http cache will be cleared. Possible values are:  * **None** \u2013 Defines that all Virtual Clients simulate a browser with no available cache. * **SingleCommand** \u2013 Defines that cache be cleared after each request. * **SingleCommandIfModified** \u2013 Defines that WebLOAD will check for a newer version of the cached item with every request. Whenever the engine has a request for a cached resource, the engine sends the request with an \u201cif-modified-since\u201d header. If the server responds with a 200 status, the engine will refresh the cache. * **SingleRound** \u2013 Defines that cache be cleared after each script execution round. This is the default value for the HttpCacheScope property. * **WholeRun** \u2013 Defines that the cache will never be cleared.

Image objects are accessed through Images [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)). (Compare to the element (see [*element (object)* ](#_bookmark102)on page [80](#_bookmark102)) object, which stores the parsed data for a single HTML form element, where the element may be any one of a variety of types, and the form (see [*form (object)* ](#_bookmark125)on page [95](#_bookmark125)) object, which stores the parsed data for an entire HTML form.)  image objects are grouped together within collections of images, accessed directly through the document object (document.images[#]).  **Syntax**  To find out how many image objects are contained within a document, check the value of:  document.images.length  Access each image\u2019s properties directly using the following syntax:  `document.images[*index*#].&lt;*image-property*&gt;`  **Example**  `document.images[1].src`  **Properties**  * id (see [*id (property)* ](#_bookmark208)on page [146](#_bookmark208)) * InnerLink (see [*InnerLink (property)* ](#_bookmark220)on page [155](#_bookmark220)) * Name (see [*Name (property)* ](#_bookmark253)on page [174](#_bookmark253)) * OuterLink (see [*OuterLink (property)* ](#_bookmark265)on page [186](#_bookmark265)) * protocol (see [*protocol (property)* ](#_bookmark294)on page [210](#_bookmark294)) * src (see [*src (property)* ](#_bookmark371)on page [252](#_bookmark371)) * Url (see [*Url (property)* ](#_bookmark422)on page [289](#_bookmark422))  **See also**  * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)) * form (see [*form (object)* ](#_bookmark125)on page [95](#_bookmark125)) * [*Select* ](#_bookmark329)(on page [230](#_bookmark329))  ## IncludeFile() (function)  **Description**  Instructs WebLOAD to include the specified file, and optionally execute scripts that are stored within that file, as part of the initialization process before beginning the main script execution rounds. Encourages modular programming by enabling easy access to sets of library function files.  **Syntax**  `IncludeFile(filename[, WLExecuteScript])`  **Parameters**  | **Parameter Name** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | filename                 | A string or variable  containing the full literal name of the file to be included. WebLOAD assumes  that the file is located in the default directory specified in the File  Locations tab (User Include Files entry) in the**Tools** **\u0086**  **Global Options** dialog box in the WebLOAD  Console or in the **Tools** **\u0086** **Settings** dialog box in the WebLOAD Recorder. For additional information about  the included file\u2019s location, refer to *Determining  the Included File Location* in the *WebLOAD  Scripting Guide*. Once the file is found, any functions or variables  defined within that file are compiled and included within the calling script  when the script is compiled. | | WLExecuteScript          | WLExecuteScript  is a global  constant that acts as a flag when passed as a parameter to IncludeFile(). WLExecuteScript is an optional parameter. When included, WebLOAD  will not only compile the definitions found in the specified file. WebLOAD  will also execute any additional commands or functions found within that file  outside the included function definitions. With WLExecuteScript  , WebLOAD  enables work with self- initializing include files that can define, set, and  execute the commands necessary to initialize a work environment at compile  time.                                                                                                                                                              |  **Example**  To include the external file MyFunction.js, located on the WebLOAD Console during WebLOAD testing, use the following command:   <pre><code>function InitAgenda() \n\n{ \n\nIncludeFile(\u201cMyFunction.js\u201d)\n\n}\n</code></pre>   **Comment**  The IncludeFile command must be inserted in the InitAgenda() section of your JavaScript program.  The load engine first looks for the file to be included in the default User Include Files directory. If the file is not there, the file request is handed over to WebLOAD, which searches for the file using the following search path order:  1. If a full path name has been hardcoded into the IncludeFile command, the system searches the specified location. If the file is not found in an explicitly coded directory, the system returns an error code of File Not Found and will not search in any other locations.  &gt; **Note:** It is not recommended to hardcode a full path name, since the script will then not be portable between different systems. This is especially important for networks that use both UNIX and Windows systems.  2. Assuming no hardcoded full path name in the script code, the system looks for the file in the current working directory, the directory from which WebLOAD was originally executed. 3. Finally, if the file is still not found, the system searches for the file sequentially through all the directories listed in the File Locations tab.  **See also**  * Close() (see [*Close() (function)* ](#_bookmark61)on page [52](#_bookmark61)) * CopyFile() (see [*CopyFile() (function)* ](#_bookmark76)on page [61](#_bookmark76)) * Delete() (see [*D*](#_bookmark93)[*elete() (cookie method)* ](#_bookmark93)on page [75](#_bookmark95)) * [*File Management Functions* ](#_bookmark25)(on page [*28*](#_bookmark25)) * GetLine() (see [*GetLine() (function)* ](#_bookmark166)on page [123](#_bookmark166)) * Open() (see [*Open() (function)* ](#_bookmark261)on page [183](#_bookmark261)) * Reset() (see [*Reset() (method)* ](#_bookmark310)on page [220](#_bookmark310)) * [*Using the IntelliSense JavaScript Editor* ](#_bookmark18)(on page [18](#_bookmark18)) * wlOutputFile (see [*wlOutputFile (object)* ](#_bookmark475)on page [323](#_bookmark475)) * wlOutputFile() (see [*wlOutputFile (object)* ](#_bookmark475)on page [323](#_bookmark475)) * Write() (see [*Write() (method)* ](#_bookmark504)on page [343](#_bookmark504)) * Writeln() (see [*Writeln() (method)* ](#_bookmark506)on page [344](#_bookmark506))  ## Index (property)  **Property of Objects**  * frames (see [*frames (object)* ](#_bookmark129)on page [99](#_bookmark129))  **Description**  Sets or retrieves the index number of the parent object.

The value of this property is defined using the WebLOAD Console or WebLOAD Recorder and overrides the JVM definition in webload.ini.  The value (string) of this property is the key for WLJVMs.xml. This file (located on every WebLOAD Machine in the ``\\extensions\\JVMs directory) contains the following parameters for each JVM:  * Type (the value from the flag) * Path (should be machine-agnostic) * Options  When Type is \"Default\", the RadView default (installed) JVM will be used. The default JVM\u2019s path is defined in webload.ini, as it depends on the WebLOAD installation path.  &gt; **Note:** The classpath definitions are defined in webload.ini.  **GUI mode**  In WebLOAD Console, select a JVM from the **Select run-time JVM to be used** drop- down list in the Java Options tab of the **Current Session Options** dialog box, accessed from the **Tools** tab of the ribbon.  In WebLOAD Recorder, select a JVM from the **Select run-time JVM to be used** drop- down list in the Java Options tab of the **Default** or **Current Project Options** dialog box, accessed from the **Tools** tab of the ribbon.  ## KDCServer (property)  **Property of Objects**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object)  **Description**  Specifies the address of the Key Distribution Center (KDC) server if you are using the Kerberos authentication method.  &gt;     **Note:** The KDCServer property is only relevant for playback.  **Syntax**  `KDCServer(ServerName)`  **Parameters**  | **Parameter Name** | **Description**                                                            | | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | ServerName               | The name of the KDC server if you are using the  Kerberos authentication method. |  **Example**  wlGlobals.KDCServer = \u201cqa4\u201d  **GUI mode**  To specify the name of the KDC server if you are using the Kerberos authentication method:  * In WebLOAD Console, select the Kerberos radio button and enter the address of the KDC server in the Kerberos Server field in the Authentication tab of the **Default**, **Current Session**, or **Script Options** dialog box, accessed from the **Tools** tab of the ribbon. * In WebLOAD Recorder, select the Kerberos radio button and enter the address of the KDC server in the Kerberos Server field in the Authentication tab of the **Default** or **Current Project Options** dialog box, accessed from the **Tools** tab of the ribbon.  **Comment**  Only the server name should be specified in KDCServer. For example, specify \u201cqa4\u201d rather than \u201cqa4.radview.co.il\u201d.  **See also**  * AuthType (see [*AuthType (property)* ](#_bookmark46)on page [40](#_bookmark46))  ## KeepAlive (property)  **Property of Objects**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  **Description**  Enable WebLOAD to keep an HTTP connection alive between successive accesses in the same round of the main script. The possible values are:  * **false** \u2013 Do not keep an HTTP connection alive. * **true** \u2013 Keep the connection alive if the server permits. (default)  Keeping a connection alive saves time between accesses. WebLOAD attempts to keep the connection alive unless you switch to a different server. However, some HTTP servers may refuse to keep a connection alive.  Use the wlHttp.CloseConnection() method to explicitly close a connection that you have kept alive. Otherwise, the connection is automatically closed at the end of each round.  **Comment**  You should not keep a connection alive if establishing the connection is part of the performance test.  **GUI mode**  WebLOAD recommends maintaining or closing connections through the WebLOAD Console. Enable maintaining connections for the Load Generator or for the Probing Client during a test session by checking the appropriate box in the Browser Parameters tab of the **Default Options** dialog box, accessed from the **Tools** tab of the ribbon.  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * CloseConnection() (see [*CloseConnection() (method)* ](#_bookmark62)on page [53](#_bookmark62)) * *Rules of Scope for Local and Global Variables* in the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide* * *Working with HTTP Protocol* in the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide*  ## KeepRedirectionHeaders (property)  **Property of Object**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object)  **Description**  Used to indicate whether to get the location headers of all redirections. The default value of KeepRedirectionHeaders is false.  **Example**  wlGlobals.KeepRedirectionHeaders = true  **Comment**  This property is useful for the following scenario, which occurs in correlation. During a  redirection, in the middle of one of the URLs, there is a parameter in the Location header that is needed for the next Get. Since only the headers of the last Get in a series of redirections are stored in document.wlHeaders, the KeepRedirectionHeaders property, when set to true, enables all the headers in a series of redirections to be saved. The value can be extracted from document.wlHeaders after the navigation is complete.  **See also**  * SaveHeaders (see [*SaveHeaders (property)* ](#_bookmark319)on page [225](#_bookmark319))  ## key (property)  **Property of Objects**  * Header (see [*Header (property)* ](#_bookmark195)on page [140](#_bookmark195)) * wlHeaders (see [*wlHeaders (object)* ](#_bookmark462)on page [314](#_bookmark461)) * wlSearchPairs (see [*wlSearchPairs (object)* ](#_bookmark480)on page [327](#_bookmark481))  **Description**  The search key name (read-only).  **Syntax**  ##### For wlHeaders:  document.wlHeaders[*index#*].key = \u201cTextString\u201d  ##### For wlSearchPairs:  document.links[1].wlSearchPairs[*index#*].key = \u201cTextString\u201d  ##### For wlHttp.Header:  wlHttp.Header[\u201ckey\u201d] = \u201cTextString\u201d  **Example**  ##### For wlHeaders:  document.wlHeaders[0].key = \u201cServer\u201d  ##### For wlSearchPairs:  document.links[1].wlSearchPairs[0].key = \u201cServer\u201d  ##### For wlHttp.Header:  wlHttp.Header[\u201ckey\u201d] = \u201cServer\u201d  **See also**  * value (see [*value (property)* ](#_bookmark430)on page [294](#_bookmark430))  ## language (property)  **Property of Object**  * script (see [*script (object)* ](#_bookmark323)on page [228](#_bookmark323))  **Description**  Retrieves the language in which the current script is written.  **Example**  \u201cjavascript\u201d specifies that the script is written in JavaScript. \u201cvbscript\u201d specifies that the script is written in Visual Basic Script.  ## link (object)  **Property of Objects**  Links on a Web page are accessed through link objects that are grouped into collections of links. The links collection is a property of the document object.  **Description**  A link object contains information on an external document to which the current document is linked. Each link object points to one of the URL links (HTML `` elements) within the document. Each link object stores the parsed data for the HTML link (`` element).  link objects are local to a single thread. You cannot create new link objects using the JavaScript new operator, but you can access HTML links through the properties and methods of the standard DOM objects. link properties are read-only.  link objects are organized into Collections (see [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)on page [27](#_bookmark23)) of links or anchors. To access an individual link\u2019s properties, check the length property of the links collection and use an index number to access the individual links.  **Syntax**  To find out how many link objects are contained within a document, check the value of:  document.links.length  Access each link\u2019s properties directly using the following syntax:  document.links[#].&lt;*link-property*&gt;  **Example**  `document.links[1].protocol`  **Properties**  * hash (see [*hash (property)* ](#_bookmark192)on page [139](#_bookmark192)) * host (see [*host (property)* ](#_bookmark197)on page [142](#_bookmark197)) * hostname (see [*hostname (property)* ](#_bookmark197)on page [142](#_bookmark197)) * href (see [*href (property)* ](#_bookmark201)on page [143](#_bookmark201)) * id (see [*id (property)* ](#_bookmark208)on page [146](#_bookmark208)) * InnerImage (see [*InnerImage (property)* ](#_bookmark220)on page [155](#_bookmark220)) * InnerText (see [*InnerText (property)* ](#_bookmark223)on page [156](#_bookmark223)) * Name (see [*Name (property)* ](#_bookmark253)on page [174](#_bookmark253)) * pathname (see [*pathname (property)* ](#_bookmark286)on page [204](#_bookmark286)) * port (see [*port (property)* ](#_bookmark286)on page [204](#_bookmark286)) * protocol (see [*protocol (property)* ](#_bookmark294)on page [210](#_bookmark294)) * search (see [*search (property)* ](#_bookmark326)on page [229](#_bookmark326)) * target (see [*target (property)* ](#_bookmark409)on page [280](#_bookmark409)) * title (see [*title (property)* ](#_bookmark415)on page [284](#_bookmark415)) * Url (see [*Url (property)* ](#_bookmark422)on page [289](#_bookmark422)) * wlSearchPairs (see [*wlSearchPairs (object)* ](#_bookmark480)on page [327](#_bookmark481))  **See also**  * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)) * document (see [*document (object)* ](#_bookmark100)on page [78](#_bookmark100))  ## load() (method)  **Method of Objects**  XML DOM objects on a Web page are accessed through collections of wlXmls objects. The load() function is a method of the following object:  * wlXmls (see [*wlXmls (object)* ](#_bookmark502)on page [340](#_bookmark502))  **Description**  Call load(URL) to download XML documents from a website and automatically load these documents into XML DOM objects.  Do not include any external references when using load().  load() relies on the MSXML parser to performs any HTTP transactions needed to download the XML document. The MSXML module accesses external servers and completes all necessary transactions without any control or even knowledge on the part of the WebLOAD system tester. From WebLOAD\u2019s perspective, these transactions are never performed in the context of the test session. For this reason, any settings that the user enters through the WebLOAD script or Console will not be relayed to the MSXML module and will have no effect on the document \u2018load\u2019. For the same reason, the results of any transactions completed this way will not be included in the WebLOAD statistics reports.  **Syntax**  `load(URLString)`  **Parameters**  | **Parameter Name** | **Description**                                                           | | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | URLString                | String parameter with the URL or filename where  the XML document may be found. |  **Example**  `myXMLDoc = document.wlXmls[0] myXMLdoc.load([\u201chttp://server/xmls/file.xml](http://server/xmls/file.xml)\u201d)`  **Comment**  You may use load() repeatedly to load and reload XML data into XML DOM objects. Remember that each new \u2018load\u2019 into an XML DOM object will overwrite any earlier data stored in that object.  **See also**  * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)) * id (see [*id (property)* ](#_bookmark208)on page [146](#_bookmark208)) * InnerHTML (see [*InnerHTML (property)* ](#_bookmark219)on page [154](#_bookmark219)) * loadXML() (see [*loadXML() (method)* ](#_bookmark242)on page [167](#_bookmark242)) * [*load() and loadXML() Method Comparison* ](#_bookmark238)(on page [164](#_bookmark238)) * src (see [*src (property)* ](#_bookmark371)on page [252](#_bookmark371)) * XMLDocument (see [*XMLDocument (property)* ](#_bookmark509)on page [345](#_bookmark509))  ## load() and loadXML() Method Comparison  **Description**  WebLOAD supports both the load() and the loadXML() methods to provide the user with maximum flexibility. The following table summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each method:  |                     | **Advantages**                                                                                               | **Disadvantages**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | **loadXML()** | Parameters that the user has defined through  WebLOAD for the testing session will be applied to this transaction. | The method fails if the  DTD section of the XML document string includes any external references.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | | **load()**    | The user may load XML files that include  external references in the DTD section.                                  | Parameters that the user  has defined through WebLOAD for the testing session will not be applied to  this transaction.  WebLOAD does not record the HTTP Get operation.  The transaction results  are not included in the session statistics report.  Using this method may  adversely affect the test session results. |  **Comment**  If you wish to measure the time it took to load the XML document using the load() method, create a timer whose results will appear in the WebLOAD statistics. For example:  `myXMLDoc = document.wlXmls[0]`  `SetTimer(\u201cGetXMLTime\u201d)`  `myXMLdoc.load([\u201chttp://server/xmls/file.xml](http://server/xmls/file.xml)\u201d)`  `SendTimer(\u201cGetXMLTime\u201d)`  **See also**  * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)) * id (see [*id (property)* ](#_bookmark208)on page [146](#_bookmark208)) * InnerHTML (see [*InnerHTML (property)* ](#_bookmark219)on page [154](#_bookmark219)) * load() (see [*load() (method)* ](#_bookmark236)on page [163](#_bookmark236)) * loadXML() (see [*loadXML() (method)* ](#_bookmark242)on page [167](#_bookmark242)) * src (see [*src (property)* ](#_bookmark371)on page [252](#_bookmark371)) * wlXmls (see [*wlXmls (object)* ](#_bookmark502)on page [340](#_bookmark502)) * XMLDocument (see [*XMLDocument (property)* ](#_bookmark509)on page [345](#_bookmark509))  ## LoadGeneratorThreads (property)  **Property of Object**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  **Description**  Optionally, WebLOAD can allocate extra threads to download nested images and frames.  For clients that you define in a Load Generator, this option is controlled by the LoadGeneratorThreads property. The default value of this property is **Single**, which means that Virtual Clients will not use extra threads to download data from the Server.  For the Probing Client, the option is controlled by the ProbingClientThreads property. The default is **Multiple**, which means that the client can use three extra threads for nested downloads. This simulates the behavior of Web browsers, which often use extra threads to download nested images and frames.  The possible values of these properties are:  * **Single** \u2013 Do not use extra threads to download nested images and frames. (default for LoadGeneratorThreads) * **Multiple** \u2013 Allocate three extra threads per client (for a total of four threads per client) to download nested images and frames (default for ProbingClientThreads). * Any specific number of threads between 1 and 8, such as \u201c5\u201d \u2013 Allocate that exact number of extra threads per client to download nested images and frames.  **Example**  You can assign any of these properties independently within a single script. In that case, if you configure a Probing Client to run the script, WebLOAD uses the value of ProbingClientThreads and ignores LoadGeneratorThreads (vice versa if you configure a Load Generator to run the script). For example, you might write:   <pre><code>function InitAgenda() {\n\n//Do not use extra threads if a\n\n// Probing Client runs the script\n\nwlGlobals.ProbingClientThreads = \u201cSingle\u201d\n\n//Use extra threads if a\n\n// Load Generator runs the script wlGlobals.LoadGeneratorThreads = \u201cMultiple\u201d\n\n}\n</code></pre>   **Comment**  The extra threads have no effect on the ClientNum value of the client. The ClientNum variable reports only the main thread number of each client, not the extra threads.  **GUI mode**  WebLOAD recommends enabling or disabling multi-threaded virtual clients through the WebLOAD Console. Enable multi-threading for the Load Generator or for the Probing Client during a test session by checking the appropriate box in the Browser Parameters tab of the **Default** or **Current Session Options** dialog box and setting the number of threads you prefer.  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * ProbingClientThreads (see [*ProbingClientThreads (property)* ](#_bookmark291)on page [208](#_bookmark291)) * *Rules of Scope for Local and Global Variables* in the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide*  ## loadXML() (method)  **Method of Object**  XML DOM objects on a Web page are accessed through collections of wlXmls objects. The loadXML() function is a method of the following objects:  * wlXmls (see [*wlXmls (object)* ](#_bookmark502)on page [340](#_bookmark502))  **Description**  Call loadXML(XMLDocString) to load XML documents into XML DOM objects. This allows users to work with XML documents and data that did not originate in HTML Data Islands, such as with Native Browsing. In a typical scenario, a user downloads an XML document. WebLOAD saves the document contents in string form. The string is then used as the parameter for loadXML(). The information is loaded automatically into an XML object.  &gt; **Note:** Creating a new, blank XML DOM object with WLXmlDocument() and then loading it with a parsed XML string using loadXML() is essentially equivalent to creating a new XML DOM object and loading it immediately using WLXmlDocument(xmlStr). As with the WLXmlDocument(xmlStr) constructor, only standalone, self-contained DTD strings may be used for the loadXML() parameter. External references in the DTD section are not allowed.  **Syntax** loadXML(XMLDocStr) **Parameters**  **Example**  `//create a new XML document object NewXMLObj = new WLXmlDocument() wlHttp.SaveSource = true`  `[wlHttp.Get(\u201chttp://www.server.com/xmls/doc.xml](http://www.server.com/xmls/doc.xml)\u201d) XMLDocStr = document.wlSource`  `//load the new object with XML data`  `//from the saved source. We are assuming`  `//no external references, as explained above NewXMLObj.loadXML(XMLDocStr)`  **Comment**  You may use loadXML() repeatedly to load and reload XML data into XML DOM objects. Remember that each new \u2018load\u2019 into an XML DOM object will overwrite any earlier data stored in that object.  **See also**  * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)) * id (see [*id (property)* ](#_bookmark208)on page [146](#_bookmark208)) * InnerHTML (see [*InnerHTML (property)* ](#_bookmark219)on page [154](#_bookmark219)) * load() (see [*load() (method)* ](#_bookmark236)on page [163](#_bookmark236)) * [*load() and loadXML() Method Comparison* ](#_bookmark238)(on page [164](#_bookmark238)) * src (see [*src (property)* ](#_bookmark371)on page [252](#_bookmark371)) * XMLDocument (see [*XMLDocument (property)* ](#_bookmark509)on page [345](#_bookmark509))  ## location (object)  **Property of Objects**  * document (see [*document (object)* ](#_bookmark100)on page [78](#_bookmark100))  **Description**  A location object stores the parsed URL and location data of the frame or root window. For an overview of parsing, see *Parsing Web pages* in the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide*.  location objects are local to a single thread. You cannot create new location objects using the JavaScript new operator, but you can access HTML locations through the properties and methods of the standard DOM objects.

This allows testers to simulate clients with different IP addresses using only one Load Generator. You must first generate additional IP addresses on your machine to use when testing and then set the MultiIPSupport property to true to enable multiple IP support. For more information about generating additional IP addresses, see *Generating IP Addresses in the script* in the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide*.  &gt; **Note:** Setting the MultiIPSupport property to true without generating additional IP addresses on your machine will not enable multiple IP support.  The possible values of wlGlobals.MultiIPSupport are:  * **false** \u2013 Use only one IP address. (default) * **true** \u2013 Use all available IP addresses.  When connecting Load Generators through a modem, MultiIPSupport should be set to false.  Probing Clients use only one IP address. Load Generators are set by default to use only one IP address, but may be set to use multiple IP addresses through the MultiIPSupport property.  **GUI mode**  In WebLOAD Console, check or uncheck **Multi IP Support** in the HTTP Parameters tab of the **Default** or **Current Session Options** dialog box, accessed from the **Tools** tab of the ribbon.  In WebLOAD Recorder, check or uncheck **Multi IP Support** in the HTTP Parameters tab of the **Default** or **Current Project Options** dialog box, accessed from the **Tools** tab of the ribbon.  **Comment**  When the Load Generator has more than one IP address (one or more addresses on a network interface card or one or more network interface cards) WebLOAD uses ALL of the available IP addresses. Before setting MultiIPSupport to true, make sure that all of the Applications Being Tested to which the script refers are accessible through all the network interface cards.  Use the GetIPAddress() (see [*GetIPAddress() (method)* ](#_bookmark163)on page [122](#_bookmark163)) method to check the identity of the current IP address.  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * GetIPAddress() (see [*GetIPAddress() (method)* ](#_bookmark163)on page [122](#_bookmark163)) * *Rules of Scope for Local and Global Variables* in the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide* * MultiIPSupportType() (see [*MultiIPSupportType (property)* ](#_bookmark251)on page [172](#_bookmark251))  ## MultiIPSupportType (property)  **Property of Objects**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  **Description**  The MultiIPSupportType property works with the wlGlobals.MultiIPSupport  property, and supports the following values:  * **PerClient** (default) \u2013 Preserves the current behavior. This means that there are different IPs per client but the same IP is used for all rounds. * **PerRound** \u2013 Supports the use of a different IP from the pool per client, per round, until the pool is exhausted, after which it returns to the beginning.  This property is only referenced when wlGlobals.MultiIPSupport is true.  &gt; **Note:** To support multiple IP addresses, you must generate additional IP addresses on your machine and then set the MultiIPSupport property to true. For more information about generating additional IP addresses, see *Generating IP Addresses in the script* in the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide*.  **GUI mode**  In WebLOAD Console, check or uncheck **Multi IP Support** in the HTTP Parameters tab of the **Default** or **Current Session Options** dialog box, accessed from the **Tools** tab of the ribbon.  In WebLOAD Recorder, check or uncheck **Multi IP Support** in the HTTP Parameters tab of the **Default** or **Current Project Options** dialog box, accessed from the **Tools** tab of the ribbon.  **Comment**  When the Load Generator has more than one IP address (one or more addresses on a network interface card or one or more network interface cards), WebLOAD uses ALL of the available IP addresses. Before setting MultiIPSupport to true, make sure that all of the Systems under Test (SUT) to which the script refers are accessible through all the network interface cards.

When working with a wlMetas collection, the Name property holds the value of the NAME attribute of the META tag.  When working with an elements collection, the Name property holds the HTML name attribute of the form element (read-only string). The is the identification string for elements of type Button, CheckBox, File, Image, Password, Radio, Reset, Select, Submit, Text, and TextArea. The name attribute is required. If a form element does not have a name, WebLOAD does not include it in the elements collection.  **Syntax**  Collection members may be accessed either through an index number or through a member name, if it exists. For example:  Access the first child window on a Web page using the following expression:  ``frames[0]``  Access the first child window\u2019s link objects directly using the following syntax:  ``frames[0]`.`frames[0]`.links[#].&lt;*property*&gt;`  Alternatively, you may access a member of the frames collection by its HTML name attribute. For example:  `document.frames[\u201cnamestring\u201d]`  -Or-  document.frames.namestring  **See also**  * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)) * content (see [*content (property)* ](#_bookmark68)on page [56](#_bookmark68)) * httpEquiv (see [*httpEquiv (property)* ](#_bookmark204)on page [144](#_bookmark204)) * Url (see [*Url (property)* ](#_bookmark422)on page [289](#_bookmark422))  ## NTUserName, NTPassWord (properties)  **Properties of Objects**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  **Description**  The user name and password that the script uses for Windows NT Challenge response authentication (NT Challenge Response).  **Comments**  A user is only authenticated once during a round with a set of credentials. Each subsequent request will use these credentials regardless of what is contained in the script. If the value of these credentials are changed after authentication, they will only be used during the next round, not during the current round.  For example, if you are trying to send a request to a URL with a group of users (user1, user2, and user3), but user1 has already been authenticated, the login is always performed for user1 until the round is complete.  **GUI mode**  By default, WebLOAD senses the appropriate authentication configuration settings for the current test session.  If you prefer to explicitly set authentication values, WebLOAD recommends setting user authentication values through the WebLOAD Console. Enter user authentication information through the Authentication tab of the **Default** or **Current Options** dialog box, accessed from the **Tools** tab of the ribbon.  **Syntax**  You may also set NT user values using the wlGlobals properties. For example:  `wlGlobals.NTUserName = \u201cBill\u201d`  `wlGlobals.NTPassWord = \u201cClassified\u201d`  **Comment**  WebLOAD automatically sends the user name and password when a wlHttp object connects to an HTTP site. If an HTTP server requests NT Challenge Response authentication and you have not assigned values to NTUserName and NTPassWord, WebLOAD submits the Windows NT user name and password under which the script is running.  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * *Rules of Scope for Local and Global Variables* in the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide* * *Working with HTTP Protocol* in the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide*  ## Num() (method)  **Method of Object**  * wlRand (see [*wlRand (object)* ](#_bookmark478)on page [326](#_bookmark478))  **Description**  Return a random integer.  **Syntax**  wlRand.Num([seed])  **Return Value**  A random integer.  **Example**  wlRand.Num(12345)  **See also**  * Range() (see [*Range() (method)* ](#_bookmark300)on page [215](#_bookmark300)) * Seed() (see [*Seed() (method)* ](#_bookmark326)on page [229](#_bookmark326)) * Select() (see [*Select() (method)* ](#_bookmark329)on page [230](#_bookmark329))  ## onDataReceived (property)  **Property of Object**  * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object)  **Description**  Define a callback function to be called every time more data is received for the request. This is useful for working with asynchronous requests (when wlHttp.Async=true) that need to be inspected before they are completed, for example in an HTTP streaming push scenario.  Use the callback function to handle the asynchronous request, for example \u2013 validate the response and make a further request.  The callback function argument is a *limited* \u2018document\u2019 object. The document object contains only the following properties:  * wlSource (see [*wlSource (property)* ](#_bookmark485)on page [330](#_bookmark485)) * wlStatusNumber (see [*wlStatusNumber (property)* ](#_bookmark488)on page [331](#_bookmark488)) * wlStatusLine (see [*wlStatusLine (property)* ](#_bookmark486)on page [331](#_bookmark486))  &gt; **Note:** The callback is expected to run in a timely manner, because it blocks the execution of other callback functions.

All values  are enumerated numeric values. Possible values are:``WLFileSequential. Every client gets the  next value/row from the file, where there might be multiple access to the same line by different Load Generator  machines. This is the default value.  ``WLFileSequentialUnique. Gets the next unique  value/row from the file. Preferably, the unique value is the next available  value in sequential order. If another VC is using this value/row, the VC is  not able to access this value/row and will get the next available value/row.  It is recommended to have more values/rows in the file than the number of  clients to avoid delays.  ``WLFileRandom. Gets a random value/row  from the file. There might be multiple access to the same line by different  Load Generator machines.  ``WLFileRandomUnique. Gets a unique, unused value/row randomly from the file. It is  recommended to have more values/rows in the file than the number of clients  to avoid  delays.                                                                                                         | | ShareMethod              | An optional parameter indicating how the  file is shared among scripts. All values are enumerated numeric values.  Possible values are:``**WLFileNotShared**. The file can be read only by the current script, and each Load  Generator machine manages a copy of  the file for its VCs independently. If there are multiple Load Generator  processes on a single machine, then the processes share the file. This is the  default value.  ``**WLFileLGShared**. The file can be read only by the  current script, and all Load Generators on any Load Generator machine  share the same copy of the file, which is synchronized between them.  ``**WLFileAgendaShared**. The file can be shared by more than one script.  The unique identifier of the file is its path. The file can be shared by  different scripts, but a copy of the file is managed separately for each Load  Generator machine. If you are using the script\u2013Shared share method, all the  scripts sharing the file should use the WLFileSequentialUnique access method.  ``**WLFileAgendaLGShared**. A single file is shared among Load Generators and among scripts.                                 | | UsageMethod              | An optional parameter that  defines when to release the value/row back to the \u2018pool\u2019 so that it can be  read again from the file. This parameter is only relevant for the  WLFileSequentialUnique and WLFileRandomUnique access methods. All values are  enumerated numeric values. Possible values are:``**WLFilePerRound**. The script reads a new  value/row from the file once every  round. The value/row is released at the end of the round. This is the default value.  ``**WLFileOncePerClient**. The script reads a new value/row from the file  once at the beginning of the test (in InitClient). The value/row is released  at TerminateClient.  ``**WLFileOncePerSession**. The  script reads a new value/row from the file once, at the beginning of the  session (in InitClient). The value/row is released at the end of the session  (in TerminateAgenda).  ``**WLFileAnytime**. The script can read a new  value/row from the file at any time during a round. It can read a new  value/row more than once during a round. The values are released at the end  of the round. This enables more than one  value/row  to be used concurrently and uniquely. | | EndOfFileBehavior        | An optional parameter that  defines how WebLOAD behaves when it reaches the end of the file. All values  are enumerated numeric values.**Note:** If you have defined the AccessMethod as WLFileSequential or  WLFileSequentialUnique, the EndOfFileBehavior parameter is mandatory.  Possible values are:  ``**WLFileStartOver**. Start from the beginning  of the file. This is the default value.  ``**WLFileKeepLast**. Keep the last value.  ``**WLFileAbortVC**. Abort the specific VC that  tried to read past the end of the  file. An error message is written to the log  file.  ``**WLFileAbortTest**. Abort the entire test when a VC tries to  read past the end of the  file. An error message is written to the log file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | | HeaderLines              | An optional parameter that defines the  number of header lines the file contains. All values are enumerated numeric  values. Possible values are:``0. The file does not  contain any header lines. This is the default  value.  ``. Where ``  is any number above zero. The file contains  `` header lines at  its beginning. The values contained in these header lines are not used as  parameters but as variable  names in  the JavaScript code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | | Delimiter                | (Optional) The delimiter  being used in the file.

Each option object denotes one choice in a select element, containing information about a selected form element.  option objects are local to a single thread. You cannot create new option objects using the JavaScript new operator, but you can access HTML options through the properties and methods of the standard DOM objects. option properties are read- only.  option objects are grouped together within collections of options. To access an individual option\u2019s properties, check the length property of the options collection and use an index number to access the individual options.  **Syntax**  To find out how many option objects are contained within a form element, check the value of:  `document.forms[#].elements[#].options.length`  Access each option\u2019s properties directly using the following syntax:  `document.forms[#].elements[#].options[#].&lt;*option-property*&gt;`  For example:  `document.forms[1].elements[2].options[0].selected`  **Comment**  Options only exist if the type of the parent element is ``, that is, forms[n].elements[n].type = \u201cSELECT\u201d. For example, to check whether a form element is of type `` and includes an options collection, you could use the following script:   <pre><code>function InitAgenda()\n\n{\n\nwlGlobals.Proxy = \u201cwebproxy.xyz.com:8080\u201d\n\n// Through proxy wlGlobals.SaveSource = true wlGlobals.ParseForms = true wlGlobals.ParseTables = true\n\n}\n\nfunction CheckElementType(WebTestSite)\n\n{\n\nwlHttp.Get(WebTestSite)\n\nif (document.forms.length &gt; 0)\n\nif (document.forms[0].elements.length &gt; 0)\n\n{\n\nInfoMessage(\u201cWe have a candidate. \u201c +\n\n\u201cElement type is \u201c + document.forms[0].elements[0].type)\n\nInfoMessage (\u201cdocument.forms[0].elements[0].options.length is \u201c\n\n\\+ document.forms[0].elements[0].options.length)\n\n}\n\n}\n</code></pre>   CheckElementType([\u201chttp://www.TestSite1.com/domain/pulldown.htm](http://www.TestSite1.com/domain/pulldown.htm)\u201d) CheckElementType(\u201chttp://www.TestSite2.com/\u201d) ErrorMessage(\u201cDone!\u201d)  **Properties**  * defaultselected (see [*defaultselected (property)* ](#_bookmark88)on page [72](#_bookmark88)) * selected (see [*selected (property)* ](#_bookmark337)on page [235](#_bookmark337)) * value (see [*value (property)* ](#_bookmark430)on page [294](#_bookmark430))  ## Options() (method)  **Method of Objects**  This function is implemented as a method of the following object:  * wlHttp (see [*wlHttp (object)* ](#_bookmark465)on page [316](#_bookmark465))  **Description**  Perform an HTTP or HTTPS Options command.  **Syntax**  `Options([URL])`  **Parameters**  | **Parameter Name** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | [URL]                    | An optional parameter identifying the document URL.

The Outfile will contain the data from the *next* HTTP transaction, so the Outfile  command must *precede* the next transaction.  The default is \u201c\u201c, which means do not write the response data.  If there is more than one transaction after the Outfile property, only the response data from the *first* transaction will be written. To write the response data from each transaction an Outfile statement must be placed PRIOR to *each* transaction.  The Outfile property is independent of the SaveSource property. Outfile saves in a file. SaveSource stores the downloaded data in document.wlSource, in memory.  The Outfile property is used to implement the Log Report.  **Example**  To write the response data from  `[\u201chttp://note/radview/radview.html](http://note/radview/radview.html)\u201d in \u201cc:\\temp.html\u201d`  you might write:  `wlHttp.Outfile = \u201cc:\\\\temp.html\u201d`  `[wlHttp.Get(\u201chttp://note/radview/radview.html](http://note/radview/radview.html)\u201d)`  **Comment**  The Outfile property saves *server response data*.

WebLOAD automatically uses the appropriate access protocol. For example, if a site expects clients to use the NT Authentication protocol, the appropriate user name and password will be stored and sent accordingly.  **Comments**  A user is only authenticated once during a round with a set of credentials. Each subsequent request will use these credentials regardless of what is contained in the script. If the value of these credentials are changed after authentication, they will only be used during the next round, not during the current round.  For example, if you are trying to send a request to a URL with a group of users (user1, user2, and user3), but user1 has already been authenticated, the login is always performed for user1 until the round is complete.  **GUI mode**  WebLOAD by default senses the appropriate authentication configuration settings for the current test session.  If you prefer to explicitly set authentication values, WebLOAD recommends setting user authentication values through the WebLOAD Console by entering user authentication information through the Authentication tab of the **Default** or **Current Options** dialog box, accessed from the **Tools** tab of the ribbon.  **Syntax**  You may also set user values using the wlGlobals properties. WebLOAD automatically sends the user name and password when a wlHttp object connects to an HTTP site. For example:  `wlGlobals.UserName = \u201cBill\u201d`  `wlGlobals.PassWord = \u201cTopSecret\u201d`  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * *Working with the HTTP Protocol* in the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide*  ## pathname (property)  **Property of Objects**  * link (see [*link (object)* ](#_bookmark235)on page [162](#_bookmark235)) * location (see [*location (object)* ](#_bookmark243)on page [168](#_bookmark243))  **Description**  The URI portion of the URL, including the directory path and filename (read-only string).  **Example**  `\u201c/products/order.html\u201d \u201c/search.exe\u201d`  ## port (property)  **Property of Objects**  * link (see [*link (object)* ](#_bookmark235)on page [162](#_bookmark235)) * location (see [*location (object)* ](#_bookmark243)on page [168](#_bookmark243))  **Description**  The port of the URL (read-only integer).  **Example**  80  ## Post() (method)  **Method of Object**  * wlHttp (see [*wlHttp (object)* ](#_bookmark465)on page [316](#_bookmark465))  **Description**  Perform an HTTP or HTTPS Post command.

Use *named transactions* to identify specific HTTP transactions by  name. This simplifies assigning counters when you want WebLOAD to  automatically calculate a specific transaction\u2019s occurrence, success, and  failure rates.  The run-time statistics  for transactions to which you have assigned a name appear in the Statistics  Report. For your convenience, WebLOAD offers an Automatic Transaction option.  In the WebLOAD Console, select Automatic Transaction from the General Tab of  the Global Options dialog box. Automatic Transaction is set to true by default. With Automatic Transaction,  WebLOAD automatically assigns a name to every Get and Post HTTP transaction.  This makes statistical analysis simpler, since all HTTP transaction activity  is measured, recorded, and reported for you automatically. You do not have to  remember to add naming instructions to each Get and Post command in your script. The name assigned by  WebLOAD is simply the URL used by that Get or Post transaction. If your  script includes multiple transactions to the same URL, the information will  be collected cumulatively for those transactions. |  **Example**   <pre><code>function InitAgenda() {\n\n//Set the default URL\n\nwlGlobals.Url = [\u201chttp://www.ABCDEF.com](http://www.ABCDEF.com/)\u201d\n\n}\n\n//Main script\n\n//Connect to the default URL: wlHttp.Post()\n\n//Connect to a different, explicitly set URL: wlHttp.Post(\u201chttp://www.ABCDEF.com/product_info.html\u201d)\n\n//Assign a name to the following HTTP transact: [wlHttp.Get(\u201chttp://www.ABCDEF.com/product_info.html](http://www.ABCDEF.com/product_info.html)\u201d,\n\n\u201cUpdateBankAccount\u201d)\n\n//Submit to a CGI program\n\nwlHttp.Url = [\u201chttp://www.ABCDEF.com/search.cgi](http://www.ABCDEF.com/search.cgi)\u201d wlHttp.FormData[\u201cSeachTerm\u201d] = \u201cocean+currents\u201d wlHttp.Post()\n\n//Submit to an HTTP server of any type wlHttp.FormData[\u201cFirstName\u201d] = \u201cBill\u201d wlHttp.FormData[\u201cLastName\u201d] = \u201cSmith\u201d wlHttp.Post(\u201chttp://www.ABCDEF.com/formprocessor.exe\u201d)\n\nUse named transactions as a shortcut in place of the BeginTransaction()...EndTransaction() module. For example, this is one way to identify a logical transaction unit:\n\nBeginTransaction(\u201cUpdateBankAccount\u201d) wlHttp.Get(url)\n\n// the body of the transaction\n\n// any valid JavaScript statements wlHttp.Post(url);\n\nEndTransaction(\u201cUpdateBankAccount\u201d)\n\n// and so on\n\nUsing the named transaction syntax, you could write:\n\nwlHttp.Get(url,\u201dUpdateBankAccount\u201d)\n\n// the body of the transaction\n\n// any valid JavaScript statements wlHttp.Post(url,\u201dUpdateBankAccount\u201d)\n\n// and so on\n</code></pre>   For the HTTPS protocol, include \u201chttps://\u201d in the URL and set the required properties of the wlGlobals object:  `wlHttp.Post(\u201c[https://www.ABCDEF.com](http://www.ABCDEF.com/)\u201d)`  The URL can contain a string of attribute data.  wlHttp.Post(\u201chttp://www.ABCDEF.com/query.exe\u201d+ \u201c?SearchFor=icebergs&amp;SearchType=ExactTerm\u201d)  Alternatively, you can specify the attributes in the FormData or Data property. The method automatically appends these in the correct syntax to the URL.

For clients that you define in a Load Generator, this option is controlled by the LoadGeneratorThreads property. The default value of this property is **Single**, which means that Virtual Clients will not use extra threads to download data from the server.  For the Probing Client, the option is controlled by the ProbingClientThreads property. The default is **Multiple**, which means that the client can use three extra threads for nested downloads. This simulates the behavior of Web browsers, which often use extra threads to download nested images and frames.  The possible values of these properties are:  * **Single** \u2013 Do not use extra threads to download nested images and frames. (default for LoadGeneratorThreads) * **Multiple** \u2013 Allocate three extra threads per client (for a total of four threads per client) to download nested images and frames. (default for ProbingClientThreads) * Any specific number of threads between 1 and 8, such as \u201c5\u201d \u2013 Allocate that exact number of extra threads per client to download nested images and frames.  **Example**  You can assign any of these properties independently within a single script. In that case, if you configure a Probing Client to run the script, WebLOAD uses the value of ProbingClientThreads and ignores LoadGeneratorThreads (vice versa if you configure a Load Generator to run the script). For example, you might write:   <pre><code>function InitAgenda() {\n\n//Do not use extra threads if a\n\n// Probing Client runs the script\n\nwlGlobals.ProbingClientThreads = \u201cSingle\u201d\n\n//Use extra threads if a\n\n// Load Generator runs the script\n\nwlGlobals.LoadGeneratorThreads = \u201cMultiple\u201d\n\n}\n</code></pre>   **Comment**  The extra threads have no effect on the ClientNum value of the client. The ClientNum variable reports only the main thread number of each client, not the extra threads.  **GUI mode**  WebLOAD recommends enabling or disabling multi-threaded virtual clients through the WebLOAD Console. Enable multi-threading for the Load Generator or for the Probing Client during a test session by checking the appropriate box in the Browser Parameters tab of the **Default** or **Current Session Options** dialog box and setting the number of threads you prefer  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * LoadGeneratorThreads (see [*LoadGeneratorThreads (property)* ](#_bookmark240)on page [165](#_bookmark240))  ## protocol (property)  **Property of Objects**  * Image (see [*Image (object)* ](#_bookmark210)on page [149](#_bookmark210)) * link (see [*link (object)* ](#_bookmark235)on page [162](#_bookmark235)) * location (see [*location (object)* ](#_bookmark243)on page [168](#_bookmark243))  **Description**  The HTTP protocol portion of the URL for the parent object (read-only string).  **Example**  `\u201chttps://\u201d`  ## Proxy, ProxyUserName, ProxyPassWord (properties)  **Properties of Objects**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  **Description**  Identifies the proxy server that the script uses for HTTP access.

Use *named transactions* to identify specific HTTP transactions by  name. This simplifies assigning counters when you want WebLOAD to  automatically calculate a specific transaction\u2019s occurrence, success, and  failure rates.  The run-time statistics  for transactions to which you have assigned a name appear in the Statistics  Report. For your convenience, WebLOAD offers an Automatic Transaction option.  In the WebLOAD Console, select Automatic Transaction from the General Tab of  the Global Options dialog box. Automatic Transaction is set to true by default. With Automatic Transaction,  WebLOAD automatically assigns a name to every Get, Post and Put HTTP  transaction. This makes statistical analysis simpler, since all HTTP  transaction activity is measured, recorded, and reported for you  automatically. You do not have to remember to add naming instructions to each  Get, Post and Put command in your script. The name assigned by WebLOAD is  simply the URL used by that Get, Post or Put transaction. If your script  includes multiple transactions to the same URL, the information will be  collected cumulatively for those transactions. |  **Comment**  You may not use the TransName parameter by itself. Put() expects to receive either *no* parameters, in which case it uses the script\u2019s default URL, or *one* parameter, which must be an alternate URL value, or *two* parameters, including both a URL value and the transaction name to be assigned to this transaction.  **See also**  * BeginTransaction() (see [*BeginTransaction() (function)* ](#_bookmark48)on page [42](#_bookmark48)) * CreateDOM() (see [*CreateDOM() (function)* ](#_bookmark77)on page [63](#_bookmark77)) * CreateTable() (see [*CreateTable() (function)* ](#_bookmark79)on page [65](#_bookmark79)) * Data (see [*Data (property)* ](#_bookmark80)on page [66](#_bookmark80)) * DataFile (see [*DataFile (property)* ](#_bookmark82)on page [67](#_bookmark82)) * Delete() (see [*Delete() (HTTP method)*](#_bookmark94)) on page [74](#_bookmark94) * FormData (see [*FormData (property)* ](#_bookmark127)on page [97](#_bookmark127)) * Get() (see [*Get() (transaction method)* ](#_bookmark136)on page [104](#_bookmark136)) * Head() (see [*Head() (method)* ](#_bookmark194)on page [139](#_bookmark194)) * Options() (see [*Options() (method)* ](#_bookmark266)on page [186](#_bookmark266)) * Post() (see [*Post() (method)* ](#_bookmark289)on page [205](#_bookmark289)) * ReportEvent() (see [*ReportEvent() (function)* ](#_bookmark306)on page [218](#_bookmark306)) * SetFailureReason() (see [*SetFailureReason() (function)* ](#_bookmark353)on page [243](#_bookmark353)) * VerificationFunction() (user-defined) (see [*VerificationFunction() (user-defined)*](#_bookmark434)[ *(function)* ](#_bookmark434)on page [297](#_bookmark434))  ## Range() (method)  **Method of Object**  * wlRand (see [*wlRand (object)* ](#_bookmark478)on page [326](#_bookmark478))  **Description**  Return a random integer between start and end.  **Syntax**  wlRand.Range(start, end, [seed])  **Parameters**  | **Parameter Name** | **Description**                                                                                                    | | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | start                    | Integer signifying start of specified range  of numbers.                                                                 | | end                      | Integer signifying end of specified range of  numbers.                                                                   | | [seed]                   | Optional seed integer used on first call to  this method only if there was no previous call to the wlRand.Seed() method. |  **Return Value**  A random integer that falls within the specified range.  **Example** wlRand.Num(12345) **See also**  * Num() (see [*Num() (method)* ](#_bookmark256)on page [177](#_bookmark256)) * Seed() * (see [*Seed() (method)* ](#_bookmark326)on page [229](#_bookmark326)) * Select() (see [*Select() (method)* ](#_bookmark329)on page [230](#_bookmark329))  ## ReceiveTimeout (property)  **Property of Objects**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  **Description**  WebLOAD performs read operations in a loop.

This can be HTML, XML, or Not Defined and is used to decide whether or not to parse the response. If ResponseContentType is set to HTML or XML, the content of the response is treated as either HTML or XML, as specified. If not, an algorithm checks the content type of the response. This algorithm uses two other wlGlobals: HtmlContentTypes and XmlContentTypes. These contain a list of content types that specify HTMLs and XMLs, respectively. The algorithm checks whether the content type of the response matches either of these lists.  **Syntax**  `wlGlobals.ResponseContentType = \u201cTextString\u201d`  **Example**  `wlGlobals.ResponseContentType = \u201cHTML\u201d`  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21))  ## RoundNum (variable)  **Description**  The number of times that WebLOAD has executed the main script of a client during the WebLOAD test, including the current execution. RoundNum is a read-only local variable, reporting the number of rounds for the specific WebLOAD client, no matter how many other clients may be running the same script.  RoundNum does not exist in the global context of a script (InitAgenda(), etc.). In the local context:  * In InitClient(), RoundNum = 0. * In the main script, RoundNum = 1, 2, 3, .... * In TerminateClient(), OnScriptAbort(), or  OnErrorTerminateClient(), RoundNum keeps its value from the final round.  The WebLOAD clients do not necessarily remain in synchronization. The RoundNum  may differ for different clients running the same script.  If a thread stops and restarts for any reason, the RoundNum continues from its value before the interruption. This can occur, for example, after you issue a Pause command from the WebLOAD Console.  If you mix scripts in a single Load Generator, WebLOAD maintains an independent round counter for each script. For example, if **WLFileAgendaShared** GUI mode  WebLOAD recommends accessing global system variables, including the RoundNum identification variable, through the WebLOAD Recorder. The variables that appear in this list are available for use at any point in a script file. In the WebLOAD Recorder main window, click **Variables Windows** in the **Debug** tab of the ribbon**.**.  For example, it is convenient to add RoundNum to a Message Node to clarify the round in which the messages that appear in the WebLOAD Console Log window originated.  &gt; **Note:** RoundNum can also be added directly to the code in a script through the IntelliSense Editor, described in [*Using the IntelliSense JavaScript Editor* ](#_bookmark18)(on page [18](#_bookmark18)).  **See also**  * ClientNum (see [*ClientNum (variable)* ](#_bookmark60)on page [50](#_bookmark60)) * GeneratorName() (see [*GeneratorName() (function)* ](#_bookmark131)on page [101](#_bookmark131)) * GetOperatingSystem() (see [*GetOperatingSystem() (function)* ](#_bookmark176)on page [131](#_bookmark176)) * [*Identification Variables and Functions* ](#_bookmark28)(on page [29](#_bookmark28)) * [*Using the IntelliSense JavaScript Editor* ](#_bookmark18)(on page [18](#_bookmark18)) * VCUniqueID() (see [*VCUniqueID() (function)* ](#_bookmark432)on page [296](#_bookmark432))  ## row (object)  **Property of Objects**  row objects are grouped into collections of rows. The rows collection is a property of the following objects:  * wlTables (see [*wlTables (object)* ](#_bookmark493)on page [333](#_bookmark492))  **Description**  When working with TextArea element objects, a row object contains the number of rows in the TextArea.  When working with wlTables objects, a row object contains all the data found in a single table row. Individual row objects may be addressed by index number, similar to any object within a collection.  **Syntax**  Individual row objects are addressed by index number, similar to any object within a collection. Access each row\u2019s properties directly using the following syntax:  `document.wlTables.myTable.rows[#].`  **Example**  To find out how many row objects are contained within myTable, check the value of:  `document.wlTables.myTable.rows.length`  To access a property of the 16th row in myTable, with the first row indexed at 0, you could write:  `document.wlTables.myTable.rows[15].rowIndex`  To access a property of the 4th cell in the 3rd row in myTable, counting across rows and with the first cell indexed at 0, you could write:  `document.wlTables.myTable.rows[2].cells[3].&lt;*cell-property*&gt;`  **Properties**  Each row object contains information about the data found in the cells of a single table row. The row object includes the following properties:  * cell (see [*cell (object)* ](#_bookmark49)on page [44](#_bookmark49)) (row property) * rowIndex (see [*rowIndex (property)* ](#_bookmark317)on page [224](#_bookmark317)) (row property)  **Comment**  The row object may be accessed as a member of the wlTables family of table, row, and cell objects.  **See also**  * cell * cellIndex * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)) * cols (see [*cols (property)* ](#_bookmark64)on page [54](#_bookmark64)) (wlTables property) * Compare() (see [*Compare() (method)* ](#_bookmark65)on page [55](#_bookmark65)) * CompareColumns (see [*CompareColumns (property)* ](#_bookmark65)on page [55](#_bookmark65)) * CompareRows (see [*CompareRows (property)* ](#_bookmark65)on page [55](#_bookmark65)) * Details (see [*Details (property)* ](#_bookmark96)on page [76](#_bookmark96)) * id (see [*id (property)* ](#_bookmark208)on page [146](#_bookmark208)) (wlTables property) * InnerHTML (see [*InnerHTML (property)* ](#_bookmark219)on page [154](#_bookmark219)) (cell property) * InnerText (see [*InnerText (property)* ](#_bookmark223)on page [156](#_bookmark223)) (cell property) * MatchBy (see [*MatchBy (property)* ](#_bookmark246)on page [170](#_bookmark246)) * Prepare() (see [*Prepare() (method)* ](#_bookmark291)on page [208](#_bookmark291)) * ReportUnexpectedRows (see [*ReportUnexpectedRows (property)* ](#_bookmark310)on page [220](#_bookmark310)) * rowIndex (see [*rowIndex (property)* ](#_bookmark317)on page [224](#_bookmark317)) (row property) * tagName (see [*tagName (property)* ](#_bookmark407)on page [279](#_bookmark407)) (cell property)  ## rowIndex (property)  **Property of Object**  * row (see [*row (object)* ](#_bookmark315)on page [223](#_bookmark315))  **Description**  An integer containing the ordinal index number of this row object within the parent table. Rows are indexed starting from zero, so the rowIndex of the first row in a table is 0.  **Comment**  The rowIndex property is a member of the wlTables family of table, row, and cell objects.  **See also**  * cell * cellIndex * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)) * cols (see [*cols (property)* ](#_bookmark64)on page [54](#_bookmark64)) (wlTables property) * Compare() (see [*Compare() (method)* ](#_bookmark65)on page [55](#_bookmark65)) * CompareColumns (see [*CompareColumns (property)* ](#_bookmark65)on page [55](#_bookmark65)) * CompareRows (see [*CompareRows (property)* ](#_bookmark65)on page [55](#_bookmark65)) * Details (see [*Details (property)* ](#_bookmark96)on page [76](#_bookmark96)) * id (see [*id (property)* ](#_bookmark208)on page [146](#_bookmark208)) (wlTables property) * InnerHTML (see [*InnerHTML (property)* ](#_bookmark219)on page [154](#_bookmark219)) (cell property) * InnerText (see [*InnerText (property)* ](#_bookmark223)on page [156](#_bookmark223)) (cell property) * MatchBy (see [*MatchBy (property)* ](#_bookmark246)on page [170](#_bookmark246)) * Prepare() (see [*Prepare() (method)* ](#_bookmark291)on page [208](#_bookmark291)) * ReportUnexpectedRows (see [*ReportUnexpectedRows (property)* ](#_bookmark310)on page [220](#_bookmark310)) * row (see [*row (object)* ](#_bookmark315)on page [223](#_bookmark315)) (wlTables property) * tagName (see [*tagName (property)* ](#_bookmark407)on page [279](#_bookmark407)) (cell property) * wlTables (see [*wlTables (object)* ](#_bookmark493)on page [333](#_bookmark492))  ## SaveHeaders (property)  **Property of Objects**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  **Description**  Instruct WebLOAD to store the HTML response headers in wlHeaders.  * **false** \u2013Do not store the header. (default) * **true** \u2013 Store the header in document.wlHeaders.   **Note:** This property can only be inserted manually.  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21))  ## SaveSource (property)  **Property of Objects**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  **Description**  Instruct WebLOAD to store the complete HTML source code downloaded in an HTTP command.  * **false** \u2013 Do not store the source HTML (default). * **true** \u2013 Store the source HTML in document.wlSource.  If you enable SaveSource, WebLOAD automatically stores the downloaded HTML whenever the script calls the wlHttp.Get() or wlHttp.Post() method. WebLOAD stores the most recent download in the document.wlSource property, refreshing it when the script calls wlHttp.Get() or wlHttp.Post() again. The stored code includes any scripts or other data embedded in the HTML. Your script can retrieve the code from document.wlSource and interpret it in any desired way.  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21))  ## SaveTransaction (property)  **Property of Objects**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object)  **Description**  Instruct WebLOAD to save detailed information about all transactions, both successes and failures, for later analysis in the Data Drilling reports.  By default, WebLOAD only saves detailed information about transaction failures for later analysis, since most test sessions are focused on tracking down and identifying the causes of errors and failures.  WebLOAD also provides the option of storing and analyzing the data for all transactions in a test session, successes and failures, through the SaveTransaction property. However, this property should be used carefully, since a successful test session may run for an extended period, and saving data on each transaction success could quickly use up all available disk space.  &gt; **Note:** Transaction data is only saved for the number of instances defined in the Instance limit field in the WebLOAD Console (Global Options dialog box, in the Data Drilling tab).  Possible values of the SaveTransaction property are:  * **false** \u2013 Do not store detailed data on successful transactions (default). * **true** \u2013 Store detailed data on successful transactions.  The SaveTransaction property works with the following parameters in the Functional Testing tab (Automatic Data Collection area) of the Current Session Options/Default Options dialog box in the WebLOAD Console, as follows:  * **Pages** \u2013 When selected, WebLOAD provides timers and counters for every \u201cGet\u201d in the session. When SaveTransaction is set to true, WebLOAD provides an aggregate breakdown for all objects in the page. * **Object level** \u2013 When selected, WebLOAD provides timers and counters for every object in every page. When SaveTransaction is set to true, WebLOAD provides breakdown information for every object in every page. * **HTTP level** \u2013 When selected, WebLOAD provides breakdown information for every failed transaction in every page. When SaveTransaction is set to true, WebLOAD provides breakdown information for every instance of every failed transaction in every page.  **Example**   <pre><code>function InitAgenda() \n\n{ \n\nwlGlobals.SaveTransaction = true\n\n}\n</code></pre>   **Comment**  As with all wlGlobals configuration properties, the SaveTransaction property must be set in the InitAgenda() function, as illustrated in the preceding example.  **See also**  * BeginTransaction() (see [*BeginTransaction() (function)* ](#_bookmark48)on page [42](#_bookmark48)) * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21))  ## script (object)  **Property of Object**  Scripts on a Web page are accessed through script objects that are grouped into collections of scripts. The scripts collection is a property of the following object:  * document (see [*document (object)* ](#_bookmark100)on page [78](#_bookmark100))  **Description**  Specifies a script object in the current document that is interpreted by a script engine.  script objects are grouped together within collections of scripts.  **Syntax**  The scripts collection includes a length property that reports the number of script objects within a document (read-only). To access an individual script\u2019s properties, check the length property of the scripts collection and use an index number to access the individual scripts. For example, to find out how many script objects are contained within a document, check the value of:  `document.scripts.length`  Access each script\u2019s properties directly using the following syntax:  `document.scripts[*index*#].&lt;*scripts-property*&gt;`  **Example**  document.scripts[1].language  **Properties**  * event (see [*event (property)* ](#_bookmark118)on page [92](#_bookmark118)) * id (see [*id (property)* ](#_bookmark208)on page [146](#_bookmark208)) * InnerHTML (see [*InnerHTML (property)* ](#_bookmark219)on page [154](#_bookmark219)) * language (see [*language (property)* ](#_bookmark232)on page [161](#_bookmark232)) * src (see [*src (property)* ](#_bookmark371)on page [252](#_bookmark371))  **See also**  * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23))  ## search (property)  **Property of Objects**  * link (see [*link (object)* ](#_bookmark235)on page [162](#_bookmark235)) * location (see [*location (object)* ](#_bookmark243)on page [168](#_bookmark243))  **Description**  The search attribute string of the URL, not including the initial ? symbol (read-only string).  **Example**  `\u201cSearchFor=modems&amp;SearchType=ExactTerm\u201d`  ## Seed() (method)  **Method of Object**  * wlRand (see [*wlRand (object)* ](#_bookmark478)on page [326](#_bookmark478))  **Description**  Initialize the random number generator.

The default value of SelectSwitchNum is **100**.  **Syntax**  wlGlobals.SelectSwitchNum = number  **Example** wlGlobals.SelectSwitchNum = 500 **Comment**  The following describes the basic functionality of the Load Engine.  Each read operation is limited by the RecvTimeout property. That is, the entire algorithm described below exits when it reaches the RecvTimeout timeout.  First, a send operation is performed with a request to the server:   <pre><code>numberOfIterations = 0\n\nwhile (wlGlobals.SendTimeout not exceeded) {\n\nif (numberOfIterations &lt; wlGlobals.SelectWriteSwitchNum { timeout = wlGlobals.SelectWriteTimeout\n\nsleepTime = wlGlbobals.SelectWriteSecondTimeout\n\n}\n\nelse {\n\ntimeout = wlGlobals.SelectWriteSecondTimeout\n\nsleepTime = wlGlbobals.SelectWriteTimeout\n\n}\n\nselect for read (timeout) if (socket ready) break\n\n}\n\nsend request\n</code></pre>   Then the Load Engine attempts to read the response:   <pre><code>numberOfIterations = 0\n\nwhile (wlGlobals.RecvTimeout not exceeded) {\n\nif (numberOfIterations &lt; wlGlobals.SelecSwitchNum { timeout = wlGlobals.SelecTimeout\n\nsleepTime = wlGlbobals.SelectSecondTimeout\n\n}\n\nelse {\n\ntimeout = wlGlobals.SelectSecondTimeout sleepTime = wlGlbobals.SelectTimeout\n\n}\n\nselect for write (timeout) if (socket ready) break\n\n}\n\nread response\n</code></pre>   The IO operations of the Load Engine are synchronous, basically looping and polling the sockets. The Load Engine performs a select on the socket with a timeout. If the select on the socket fails, a short sleep is performed and the system tries to perform the select again until the timeout specified in the SelectTimeout property is exceeded. This also enables the Load Engine to check with the monitor between selects to see if the session has ended.  **See also**  * SelectSecondTimeout (see [*SelectSecondTimeout (property)* ](#_bookmark331)on page [230](#_bookmark331)) * SelectTimeout (see [*SelectTimeout (property)* ](#_bookmark333)on page [232](#_bookmark333))  ## SelectTimeout (property)  **Property of Objects**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  **Description**  A timeout used when performing a select on a socket.

To change the name, add CLIENT_STATISTICS_FILE = \u201cfile-name\u201d to webload.ini on the console side. By default, this will save the raw statistics data for all the clients.  Only statistics calculated by the Load Generator are supported. Statistics like hits/second are not sent and empty statistics, for example, RoundTime where no round was completed within a time slice, are sent as -1.  **Example**  wlGlobals.SendClientStatistics = true  **See also**  * SendClientStatisticsFilter (see [*SendClientStatisticsFilter (property)* ](#_bookmark342)*on* page [236](#_bookmark342)  ## SendClientStatisticsFilter (property)  **Properties of Objects**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  **Description**  This is a very simple filter for choosing clients for which to send statistics. The format is \u201c1;4;8;\u201d. Each number is a client number and you can specify as many client numbers as you want. Ranges and wildcards are not supported. If no client numbers are specified, statistics are sent for all clients.  If spawning is being used and you specify, for example, \u201c1\u201d, statistics for the first VC will be sent for each slave process.  Only statistics calculated by the Load Generator are supported. Statistics like hits/second are not sent and empty statistics, for example, RoundTime where no round was completed within a time slice, are sent as -1.   **Note:** The filter and file name are not checked.  **Syntax**  wlGlobals.SendClientStatisticsFilter = \u201c``;``;\u201d  **Example**  `wlGlobals.SendClientStatisticsFilter = \u201c2;3;8\u201d`  **See also**  * SendClientStatistics (see [*SendClientStatistics (property)* ](#_bookmark341)on page [236](#_bookmark341))  ## SendCounter() (function)  **Description**  Use this function to count the number of times an event occurs and output the value to the WebLOAD Console.

If you wish to delete cookies in the middle of a round, use the Delete() or ClearAll() method.  **Example**  If you combine the examples used to illustrate the parameters for this method, you end up with the following:  `wlCookie.Set(\u201cCUSTOMER\u201d, \u201cJOHN_SMITH\u201d, [\u201cwww.ABCDEF.com](http://www.ABCDEF.com/)\u201d, \u201c/\u201d,`  `\u201cWed, 08-Apr-98 17:29:00 GMT\u201d)`  Where:  * The method creates a cookie containing the data CUSTOMER=JOHN_SMITH. This is the data that the thread submits when it connects to a URL in the domain. * The domain of our sample cookie is [www.ABCDEF.com/. ](http://www.ABCDEF.com/)The thread submits the cookie when it connects to any URL in or below this domain, for example,[ http://info.www.ABCDEF.com/customers/FormProcessor.exe.](http://info.www.ABCDEF.com/customers/FormProcessor.exe) * The cookie is valid until the expiration time, which in this case is Wednesday, April 8, 1998, at 17:29 GMT.  ## SetClientType (function)  **Description**  The HTTP client has the following sub types, which can be set using the SetClientType function. These sub-types are:  * **Normal** (default) \u2013 When the client type is set to Normal, a DOM is created without tables. * **Thick** \u2013 When the client type is set to Thick, the tables structure is included in the DOM. * **Thin** \u2013 When the client type is set to Thin, no DOM or headers are created, and each page is parsed only once. This type is used for very high performance with static pages.  Use the SetClientType function with the Thick sub-type when you want to parse tables or with the Thin sub-type when you want optimize tests for simple writes with static pages.  **Syntax**  setClientType(clientType)  **Example**  setClientType(thick)  **Comment**  When you call SetClientType(\u201cThin\u201d), the ParseOnce flag is set to true. Each page will only be parsed the first time it is read and the list of all the resources it accesses will be saved. The next time the page is needed, the list will be reused and no additional parsing will be performed.  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * ParseOnce (see [*ParseOnce (property)* ](#_bookmark280)*on* page [198](#_bookmark280)) * GetImagesInThinClient (see [*GetImagesInThinClient (property)* ](#_bookmark164)on page [122](#_bookmark164)) * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  ## SetFailureReason() (function)  **Description**  This function enables you to specify possible reasons for a transaction failure within your transaction verification function. These reasons will also appear in the Statistics Report. The default reason for most HTTP command (Get, Post, and Head) failures is simply HTTP-Failure. Unless you specify another reason for failure, HTTP-Failure will be set automatically whenever an HTTP transaction fails on the HTTP protocol level. SetFailureReason() allows you to add more meaningful information to your error reports.  **Syntax**  SetFailureReason(ReasonName) ****  **Comment**  The SetFailureReason() function accepts a literal string as the parameter. This string identifies the cause of the failure. To get an accurate picture of different failure causes, be sure to use identification strings consistently for each failure type. For example, don\u2019t use both \u2018User Not Logged\u2019 *and* \u2018User Not LoggedIn\u2019 for the same type of failure, or your reports statistics will not be as informative. If you do not specify a specific reason for the failure, the system will register a \u2018General Failure\u2019, the default fail value.  **See also**  * CreateDOM() (see [*CreateDOM() (function)* ](#_bookmark77)on page [63](#_bookmark77)) * BeginTransaction() (see [*BeginTransaction() (function)* ](#_bookmark48)on page [42](#_bookmark48)) * CreateTable() (see [*CreateTable() (function)* ](#_bookmark79)on page [65](#_bookmark79)) * EndTransaction() (see [*EndTransaction() (function)* ](#_bookmark113)on page [88](#_bookmark113)) * ReportEvent() (see [*ReportEvent() (function)* ](#_bookmark306)on page [218](#_bookmark306)) * TimeoutSeverity (see [*TimeoutSeverity (property)* ](#_bookmark413)on page [283](#_bookmark413)) * TransactionTime (see [*TransactionTime (property)* ](#_bookmark418)on page [287](#_bookmark418)) * [*Transaction Verification Components* ](#_bookmark39)(on page [36](#_bookmark38)) * VerificationFunction() (user-defined) (see [*VerificationFunction() (user-defined)*](#_bookmark434)[ *(function)* ](#_bookmark434)on page [297](#_bookmark434))  ## setTimeout() (function)  **Description**  Execute the specified callback after a specified number of milliseconds.  The script execution will continue immediately, not waiting for the specified time or the function to execute (unlike the [*Sleep() (function)*, ](#_bookmark364)which instructs the script to pause for a specified time).  **Syntax**  setTimeout (Func, PauseTime)  **Parameters**  | **Parameter  Name** | **Description**                                             | | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | | Func                      | Function to be called after the specified  number of milliseconds | | PauseTime                 | An integer value specifying the number of  milliseconds to pause. |  **Example**  To pause for 1 second, write:   <pre><code>InfoMessage(\u201cbefore setTimeout\u201d);\n\nsetTimeout( function() {\n\nInfoMessage(\u201cin setTimeout\u201d);\n\n} , 1000);\n\nInfoMessage(\u201cafter setTimeout\u201d);\n\nSleep(2000);\n\nInfoMessage(\u201cafter sleep\u201d);\n</code></pre>   **See also**  * [*Sleep() (function)* ](#_bookmark364)(on page [248](#_bookmark364))  ## SetTimer() (function)  **Description**  Use this function to zero a timer. Call SetTimer() in the main script of a script, immediately before any step or sequence of steps whose time you want to measure. Be sure to zero the timer in every round of the script; the timer continues running between rounds if you do not zero it.  **Syntax** SetTimer(TimerName) **Parameters**  **Example**  `SetTimer(\u201cLink 3 Time\u201d)`  **GUI mode**  WebLOAD recommends setting timer functions within script files directly through the WebLOAD Recorder. In WebLOAD Recorder, drag the Set Timer icon from the Load toolbox into the Script Tree at the desired location. The Set Timer dialog box opens.  Enter a timer name and click **OK**. The Set Timer item appears in the Script Tree and the JavaScript code is added to the script. To see the new JavaScript code, view the script in JavaScript Editing mode.  **See also**  * SendCounter() (see [*SendCounter() (function)* ](#_bookmark343)on page [237](#_bookmark343)) * SendMeasurement() (see [*SendMeasurement() (function)* ](#_bookmark345)on page [238](#_bookmark345)) * SendTimer() (see [*SendTimer() (function)* ](#_bookmark348)on page [239](#_bookmark348)) * Sleep() (see [*Sleep() (function)* ](#_bookmark363)on page [248](#_bookmark363)) * SynchronizationPoint() (see [*SynchronizationPoint() (function)* ](#_bookmark404)on page [277](#_bookmark404)) * [*Timing Functions* ](#_bookmark35)(on page [34](#_bookmark35))  ## SevereErrorMessage() (function)  **Description**  Use this function to display a severe error message in the Log Window of the WebLOAD Console, stop the session, and abort the Load Generator.  **Syntax**  SevereErrorMessage(msg)  **Comment**  If you call SevereErrorMessage() in the main script, WebLOAD stops all activity in the Load Generator and runs the error handling functions (OnScriptAbort(), etc.), if they exist in the script. You may also use the wlException (see [*wlException*](#_bookmark446) [*(object)* ](#_bookmark446)on page [306](#_bookmark446)) object with the built-in try()/catch() commands to catch errors within your script. For more information about error management and execution sequence options, see *Error Management* in the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide*.  **GUI mode**  WebLOAD recommends adding message functions to your script files directly through the WebLOAD Recorder. Drag the Message icon from the WebLOAD Recorder toolbox into the script. The Message dialog box opens. Enter the message text, select a severity level for the message, and click **OK**.  **See also**  * ErrorMessage() (see [*ErrorMessage() (function)* ](#_bookmark115)on page [90](#_bookmark115)) * GetMessage() (see [*GetMessage() (method)* ](#_bookmark172)on page [129](#_bookmark172)) * GetSeverity() (see [*GetSeverity() (method)* ](#_bookmark182)on page [134](#_bookmark182)) * InfoMessage() (see [*InfoMessage() (function)* ](#_bookmark217)on page [153](#_bookmark217)) * [*Message Functions* ](#_bookmark29)(on page [30](#_bookmark29)) * ReportLog() (see [*ReportLog() (method)* ](#_bookmark308)on page [219](#_bookmark308)) * [*Using the IntelliSense JavaScript Editor* ](#_bookmark18)(on page [18](#_bookmark18)) * WarningMessage() (see [*WarningMessage() (function)* ](#_bookmark437)on page [299](#_bookmark437)) * wlException (see [*wlException (object)* ](#_bookmark446)on page [306](#_bookmark446)) * wlException() (see [*wlException() (constructor)* ](#_bookmark448)on page [308](#_bookmark448))  ## Severity (property)  **Property of Object**  * wlVerification (see [*wlVerification (object)* ](#_bookmark497)on page [337](#_bookmark497))  **Description**  Severity is used to define the global severity of a verification fail error. When defined, Severity affects all the verifications in which severity is not defined. If you define the error severity for a specific verification, it overrides the global severity defined in the Severity property.  Possible values of the Severity property are:  * WLSuccess \u2013 The transaction terminated successfully. * WLMinorError \u2013 This specific transaction failed, but the test session may continue as usual. The script displays a warning message in the Log window and continues execution from the next statement. * WLError \u2013 This specific transaction failed and the current test round was aborted. The script displays an error message in the Log window and begins a new round. * WLSevereError \u2013 This specific transaction failed and the test session must be stopped completely. The script displays an error message in the Log window and the Load Generator on which the error occurred is stopped.  **Example**  To set the global severity of all verification fail errors to WLError, write:  `wlVerification.Severity = WLError`  **See also**  * wlVerification (see [*wlVerification (object)* ](#_bookmark497)on page [337](#_bookmark497)) * PageContentLength (see [*PageContentLength (property)* ](#_bookmark270)on page [189](#_bookmark270)) * PageTime (see [*PageTime (property)* ](#_bookmark271)on page [190](#_bookmark271)) * Function (see [*Function (property)* ](#_bookmark130)on page [100](#_bookmark130)) * ErrorMessage (see [*ErrorMessage (property)* ](#_bookmark116)on page [91](#_bookmark116)) * Title (see [*Title (function)* ](#_bookmark417)on page [285](#_bookmark417))  ## Size (property)  **Property of Object**  * element (see [*element (object)* ](#_bookmark102)on page [80](#_bookmark102)) * [*Select* ](#_bookmark328)(on page [230](#_bookmark328))  **Description**  The size of a File, Password, Select, or Text element. When working with a Select element, determines the number of rows that will be displayed, regardless of the number of options chosen.  ## Sleep() (function)  **Description**  Pause for a specified number of milliseconds.  | **Parameter  Name** | **Description**                                             | | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | | PauseTime                 | An integer value specifying the number of  milliseconds to pause. |  **Syntax** Sleep(PauseTime) **Parameters**  **Example**  To pause for 1 second, write:  Sleep(1000)  **GUI mode**  WebLOAD recommends setting sleep functions within script files directly through the WebLOAD Recorder. Drag the **Sleep ** icon from the General toolbox into the Script Tree at the desired location. The Sleep dialog box opens. Enter or select the duration of the sleep and click **OK**. The Sleep item appears in the Script Tree and the JavaScript code is added to the script.  Sleep function command lines may also be added directly to the code in a JavaScript Object within a script through the IntelliSense Editor, described in [*Using the IntelliSense*](#_bookmark18) [*JavaScript Editor* ](#_bookmark18)(on page [18](#_bookmark18)).  **Comment**  Specify one of the sleep options when running a test script in the Sleep Time Control tab, through the WebLOAD Recorder from the **Tools** \u0086 **Default** or **Current Project Options** or through the WebLOAD Console from the **Tools** \u0086 **Default** or **Current Project Options**:  * **Sleep time as recorded** \u2013 Runs the script with the delays corresponding to the natural pauses that occurred when recording the script. * **Ignore recorded sleep time (default)** \u2013 Eliminates any pauses when running the script and runs a worst-case stress test. * **Set random sleep time** \u2013 Sets the ranges of delays to represent a range of users. * **Set sleep time deviation** \u2013 Sets the percentage of deviation from the recorded value to represent a range of users.

By default, WebLOAD supports a maximum SSLBitLimit of 128 bits. Users may lower the SSLBitLimit as necessary.  You may assign an SSL bit limit value using the wlGlobals.SSLBitLimit property. Check the value of this property if you wish to verify the maximum cipher strength (SSL bit limit) available for the current test session. For example, if all ciphers are enabled, then the maximum cipher strength is 128.  &gt; **Note:** Defining an SSL bit limit with the SSLBitLimit property is a low-level approach to enabling or disabling individual protocols. Even if you prefer to program property values directly rather than working through the GUI, it is usually preferable to use the SSLCryptoStrength (see [*SSLCryptoStrength (property)* ](#_bookmark379)on page [258](#_bookmark379)) to define and enable cipher levels and cryptographic strengths using a higher, more categorical approach.  **Syntax**  `wlGlobals.SSLBitLimit` = IntegerValue  **Example**  `wlGlobals.SSLBitLimit = 56`  -Or-  CurrentBitLimit = wlGlobals.SSLBitLimit  **GUI mode**  WebLOAD recommends setting the SSL bit limit through the WebLOAD Console.

For servers that support client authentication, the server will request an identification certificate that contains information to identify the client and is signed by a recognized certificate authority. WebLOAD supports use of SSL client certificates by supplying the certificate filename and password to the SSL server. SSLClientCertificateFile and SSLClientCertificatePassword are the filename (optionally including a directory path) and password of a certificate, which WebLOAD makes available to SSL  servers. When the script issues an HTTPS Get, Post, or Head command, the server can request the certificate as part of the handshake procedure. In that case, WebLOAD sends the certificate to the server, and the server can use it to authenticate the client transmission.  You may set client certificate values using the wlGlobals properties.   **Note:** You can obtain a certificate file by exporting an X.509 certificate from Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. Then use the WebLOAD Certificate Wizard to convert the certificate to an ASCII (*.pem) format.  **Syntax**  `wlGlobals.*SSLProperty* = \u201cTextString\u201d`  **Example**  `wlGlobals.SSLClientCertificateFile = \u201cc:\\\\certs\\\\cert1.pem\u201d`  `wlGlobals.SSLClientCertificatePassword = \u201ctopsecret\u201d`  **GUI mode**  WebLOAD by default senses the appropriate authentication configuration settings for the current test session.  If you prefer to explicitly set authentication values, WebLOAD recommends setting user authentication values through the WebLOAD Console. Enter user authentication information through the Authentication tab of the **Default** or **Current Session Options** dialog box, accessed from the **Tools** tab of the ribbon.  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * SSLBitLimit (see [*SSLBitLimit (property)* ](#_bookmark373)on page [253](#_bookmark373)) (wlGlobals only) * [*SSL Cipher Command Suite* ](#_bookmark34)(on page [33](#_bookmark34)) * [*SSL Ciphers \u2013 Complete List* ](#_bookmark580)(on page [450](#_bookmark580)) * SSLCipherSuiteCommand() (see [*SSLCipherSuiteCommand() (function)* ](#_bookmark376)on page [255](#_bookmark376)) * SSLCryptoStrength (see [*SSLCryptoStrength (property)* ](#_bookmark379)on page [258](#_bookmark379)) (wlGlobals only) * SSLDisableCipherID() (see [*SSLDisableCipherID() (function)* ](#_bookmark381)on page [260](#_bookmark381)) * SSLDisableCipherName() (see [*SSLDisableCipherName() (function)* ](#_bookmark382)on page [261](#_bookmark382)) * SSLEnableCipherID() (see [*SSLEnableCipherID() (function)* ](#_bookmark385)on page [264](#_bookmark385)) * SSLEnableCipherName() (see [*SSLEnableCipherName() (function)* ](#_bookmark386)on page [265](#_bookmark386)) * SSLGetCipherCount() (see [*SSLGetCipherCount() (function)* ](#_bookmark388)on page [266](#_bookmark388)) * SSLGetCipherID() (see [*SSLGetCipherID() (function)* ](#_bookmark389)on page [267](#_bookmark389)) * SSLGetCipherInfo() (see [*SSLGetCipherInfo() (function)* ](#_bookmark392)on page [269](#_bookmark392)) * SSLGetCipherName() (see [*SSLGetCipherName() (function)* ](#_bookmark393)on page [270](#_bookmark393)) * SSLGetCipherStrength() (see [*SSLGetCipherStrength() (function)* ](#_bookmark395)on page [271](#_bookmark395)) * SSLUseCache (see [*SSLUseCache (property)* ](#_bookmark397)on page [272](#_bookmark397)) * SSLVersion (see [*SSLVersion (property)* ](#_bookmark400)on page [274](#_bookmark400))  ## SSLCryptoStrength (property)  **Property of Objects**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object)  **Description**  Used to define the cryptographic categories to be used in the current test session. The following categories are available:  * \u201cSSL_AllCrypto\u201d \u2013 Enable cryptography of all strengths (default). * \u201cSSL_StrongCryptoOnly\u201d \u2013 Enable only ciphers with strong cryptography (RSA keys greater than 512-bit and DES/EC keys greater than 40-bit). * \u201cSSL_ExportCryptoOnly\u201d \u2013 Enable only ciphers available for export, including only RSA keys 512-bit or weaker and DES/EC keys 40-bit or weaker. * \u201cSSL_ServerGatedCrypto\u201d \u2013 Verify that the communicating server is legally authorized to use strong cryptography before using stronger ciphers. Otherwise use export ciphers only.  These definitions work with your script\u2019s current set of enabled ciphers. If you have enabled only certain ciphers, then setting SSLCryptoStrength would affect only the subset of enabled ciphers.  **Example**  Assume you have enabled the following ciphers:  * DHE_DSS_ RC4_SHA * DES_CBC_MD5 * AECDH_NULL_SHA * EXP_RC4_MD5  If you then set SSLCryptoStrength to SSL_ExportCryptoOnly, then only the last two ciphers, AECDH_NULL_SHA, and EXP_RC4_MD5, will be enabled.   <pre><code>InitClient()\n\n{\n\n?\n\nSSLEnableCipherName(\u201cDHE_DSS_RC4_SHA\u201d) SSLEnableCipherName(\u201cDES_CBC_MD5\u201d) SSLEnableCipherName(\u201cAECDH_NULL_SHA\u201d) SSLEnableCipherName(\u201cEXP_RC4_MD5\u201d) wlGlobals.SSLCryptoStrength=\u201cSSL_ExportCryptoOnly\u201d\n\n?\n\n}\n</code></pre>   **Comment**  Defining a global, categorical value for SSLCryptoStrength is a high-level approach to cryptographic strength definition. This \u2018smarter\u2019 approach of selecting appropriate categories is usually preferable to the low-level approach of enabling or disabling individual protocols or defining specific SSL bit limits with the SSLBitLimit and SSLVersion properties. However, ideally SSL configuration values should be set through the WebLOAD GUI.  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * SSLBitLimit (see [*SSLBitLimit (property)* ](#_bookmark373)on page [253](#_bookmark373)) (wlGlobals only) * [*SSL Cipher Command Suite* ](#_bookmark34)(on page [33](#_bookmark34)) * [*SSL Ciphers \u2013 Complete List* ](#_bookmark580)(on page [450](#_bookmark580)) * SSLCipherSuiteCommand() (see [*SSLCipherSuiteCommand() (function)* ](#_bookmark376)on page [255](#_bookmark376)) * SSLClientCertificateFile, SSLClientCertificatePassword (see [*SSLClientCertificateFile,*](#_bookmark377)[ *SSLClientCertificatePassword (properties)* ](#_bookmark377)on page [256](#_bookmark377)) * SSLDisableCipherID() (see [*SSLDisableCipherID() (function)* ](#_bookmark381)on page [260](#_bookmark381)) * SSLDisableCipherName() (see [*S*](#_bookmark382)[*SLDisableCipherName() (function)*](#_bookmark382) on page [261](#_bookmark382)) * SSLEnableCipherID() (see [*SSLEnableCipherID() (function)* ](#_bookmark385)on page [264](#_bookmark385)) * SSLEnableCipherName() (see [*SSLEnableCipherName() (function)* ](#_bookmark386)on page [265](#_bookmark386)) * SSLGetCipherCount() (see [*SSLGetCipherCount() (function)* ](#_bookmark388)on page [266](#_bookmark388)) * SSLGetCipherID() (see [*SSLGetCipherID() (function)* ](#_bookmark389)on page [267](#_bookmark389)) * SSLGetCipherInfo() (see [*SSLGetCipherInfo() (function)* ](#_bookmark392)on page [269](#_bookmark392)) * SSLGetCipherName() (see [*SSLGetCipherName() (function)* ](#_bookmark393)on page [270](#_bookmark393)) * SSLGetCipherStrength() (see [*SSLGetCipherStrength() (function)* ](#_bookmark395)on page [271](#_bookmark395)) * SSLUseCache (see [*SSLUseCache (property)* ](#_bookmark397)on page [272](#_bookmark397)) * SSLVersion (see [*SSLVersion (property)* ](#_bookmark400)on page [274](#_bookmark400))  ## SSLDisableCipherID() (function)  **Description**  Disables the specified SSL cipher for the current session.  **Syntax**  SSLDisableCipherID(CipherID)  **Parameters**  | **Parameter  Name** | **Description**                               | | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | | CipherID                  | The SSL cipher to disable for the current  session. |  **Example**  You may wish to test your application with all but one SSL protocol enabled.

The following InitClient() function fragment disables all protocols, gets a protocol ID number, and enables the selected protocol in the InitClient() function.   <pre><code>InitClient()\n\n{\n\n\u2026\n\nSSLCipherSuiteCommand(DisableAll) MyCipherID = SSLGetCipherID(\"EXP-RC4-MD5\") SSLEnableCipherID(MyCipherID)\n\n\u2026\n\n}\n</code></pre>   **See also**  * *Browser Configuration Components* (on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * SSLBitLimit (see [*SSLBitLimit (property)* ](#_bookmark373)on page [253](#_bookmark373)) (wlGlobals only) * [*SSL Cipher Command Suite* ](#_bookmark34)(on page [33](#_bookmark34)) * [*SSL Ciphers \u2013 Complete List* ](#_bookmark580)(on page [450](#_bookmark580)) * SSLCipherSuiteCommand() (see [*SSLCipherSuiteCommand() (function)* ](#_bookmark376)on page [255](#_bookmark376)) * SSLClientCertificateFile, SSLClientCertificatePassword (see [*SSLClientCertificateFile,*](#_bookmark377)[ *SSLClientCertificatePassword (properties)* ](#_bookmark377)on page [256](#_bookmark377)) * SSLCryptoStrength (see [*SSLCryptoStrength (property)* ](#_bookmark379)on page [258](#_bookmark379)) (wlGlobals only) * SSLDisableCipherID() (see [*SSLDisableCipherID() (function)* ](#_bookmark381)on page [260](#_bookmark381)) * SSLDisableCipherName() (see [*S*](#_bookmark382)[*SLDisableCipherName() (function)* ](#_bookmark382)on page [261](#_bookmark382)) * SSLEnableCipherName() (see [*SSLEnableCipherName() (function)* ](#_bookmark386)on page [265](#_bookmark386)) * SSLGetCipherCount() (see [*SSLGetCipherCount() (function)* ](#_bookmark388)on page [266](#_bookmark388)) * SSLGetCipherID() (see [*SSLGetCipherID() (function)* ](#_bookmark389)on page [267](#_bookmark389)) * SSLGetCipherInfo() (see [*SSLGetCipherInfo() (function)* ](#_bookmark392)on page [269](#_bookmark392)) * SSLGetCipherName() (see [*SSLGetCipherName() (function)* ](#_bookmark393)on page [270](#_bookmark393)) * SSLGetCipherStrength() (see [*SSLGetCipherStrength() (function)* ](#_bookmark395)on page [271](#_bookmark395)) * SSLUseCache (see [*SSLUseCache (property)* ](#_bookmark397)on page [272](#_bookmark397)) * SSLVersion (see [*SSLVersion (property)* ](#_bookmark400)on page [274](#_bookmark400)) * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object)  ## SSLEnableCipherName() (function)  **Description**  Enables the specified SSL cipher for the current session.  **Syntax** SSLEnableCipherName(CipherName)  **Parameters**  **Example**  You may wish to test your application with only a single SSL protocol enabled.

The value of SSLUseCache may be:  * **false** \u2013 Disable caching. * **true** \u2013 Enable caching. (default)  A true value means that WebLOAD receives the key only on the first SSL connection in each round. In subsequent connections, WebLOAD retrieves the key from the cache.  Assign a true value to reduce transmission time during SSL communication. Assign a false value if you want to measure the transmission time of the decoding key in the WebLOAD performance statistics for each SSL connection.  If you enable caching, you can clear the cache at any time by calling the wlHttp.ClearSSLCache() method. The cache is automatically cleared at the end of each round.  **GUI mode**  WebLOAD recommends enabling or disabling the SSL cache through the WebLOAD Console. Enable caching for the Load Generator or for the Probing Client during a test session by checking the appropriate box in the Browser Parameters tab of the **Default Options** dialog box, accessed from the **Tools** tab of the ribbon.  **Comment**  To clear the SSL cache, set the ClearSSLCache() (see [*ClearSSLCache() (method)* ](#_bookmark59)on page [49](#_bookmark59)) property.  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * SSLBitLimit (see [*SSLBitLimit (property)* ](#_bookmark373)on page [253](#_bookmark373)) (wlGlobals only) * [*SSL Cipher Command Suite* ](#_bookmark34)(on page [33](#_bookmark34)) * [*SSL Ciphers \u2013 Complete List* ](#_bookmark580)(on page [450](#_bookmark580)) * SSLCipherSuiteCommand() (see [*SSLCipherSuiteCommand() (function)* ](#_bookmark376)on page [255](#_bookmark376)) * SSLClientCertificateFile, SSLClientCertificatePassword (see [*SSLClientCertificateFile,*](#_bookmark377)[ *SSLClientCertificatePassword (properties)* ](#_bookmark377)on page [256](#_bookmark377)) * SSLCryptoStrength (see [*SSLCryptoStrength (property)* ](#_bookmark379)on page [258](#_bookmark379)) (wlGlobals only) * SSLDisableCipherID() (see [*SSLDisableCipherID() (function)* ](#_bookmark381)on page [260](#_bookmark381)) * SSLDisableCipherName() (see [*S*](#_bookmark382)[*SLDisableCipherName() (function)*](#_bookmark382) on page [261](#_bookmark382)) * SSLEnableCipherID() (see [*SSLEnableCipherID() (function)* ](#_bookmark385)on page [264](#_bookmark385)) * SSLEnableCipherName() (see [*SSLEnableCipherName() (function)* ](#_bookmark386)on page [265](#_bookmark386)) * SSLGetCipherCount() (see [*SSLGetCipherCount() (function)* ](#_bookmark388)on page [266](#_bookmark388)) * SSLGetCipherID() (see [*SSLGetCipherID() (function)* ](#_bookmark389)on page [267](#_bookmark389)) * SSLGetCipherInfo() (see [*SSLGetCipherInfo() (function)* ](#_bookmark392)on page [269](#_bookmark392)) * SSLGetCipherName() (see [*SSLGetCipherName() (function)* ](#_bookmark393)on page [270](#_bookmark393)) * SSLGetCipherStrength() (see [*SSLGetCipherStrength() (function)* ](#_bookmark395)on page [271](#_bookmark395)) * SSLVersion (see [*SSLVersion (property)* ](#_bookmark400)on page [274](#_bookmark400))  ## SSLVersion (property)  **Property of Objects**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  **Description**  The SSL version that WebLOAD should use for the current test session. The possible values of wlGlobals.SSLVersion are:  * SSL_Version_Undetermined \u2013 (Default) WebLOAD can use any SSL protocol version, allowing the broadest interoperability with other SSL installations. WebLOAD sends initial messages using SSL 2.0, then attempts to negotiate up to SSL 3.0. If the peer requests SSL 2.0 communications, SSL 2.0 is used for further communication.   **Note:** WebLOAD does not recommend changing the default value*.*  * SSL_Version_3_0_With_2_0_Hello \u2013 WebLOAD sends initial messages using  SSL 2.0, but all subsequent communication must be through SSL 3.0 only. Otherwise the connection will fail with a meaningful error message.  * TLS_Version_1.0_With_2_0_Hello \u2013 WebLOAD sends initial messages using SSL 2.0, but all subsequent communication must be through TLS 1.0 only. Otherwise the connection will fail with a meaningful error message. * SSL_Version_3_0_Only \u2013 All communication is by SSL 3.0 only. If the peer does not support SSL 3.0, the handshake fails without a meaningful indication of why it failed. Use this option for highest security when working with peers that definitely support SSL 3.0. * TLS_Version_1_0_Only \u2013 All communication is by TLS 1.0 only. If the peer does not support TLS 1.0, the handshake fails without a meaningful indication of why it failed. Use this option for highest security when working with peers that definitely support TLS 1.0. * SSL_Version_3_0 \u2013 WebLOAD sends initial messages using SSL 3.0. If the peer requests SSL 2.0 communications, SSL 2.0 is used for further communication. * SSL_Version_2_0 \u2013 WebLOAD sends initial messages and all further communication using SSL 2.0. This option is not recommended other than for testing, because SSL 3.0 is more functional and secure than SSL 2.0. * TLS_Version_1_0 \u2013 WebLOAD sends initial messages using TLS 1.0.

If no severity level is specified, WLMinorError is assumed.  **Note:** Error levels are used for display  in the log window and do not define any logical behavior. | | Reason                   | An optional string containing the reason  for stopping the virtual client running the script.  If no reason is specified, a default message is  displayed. See[*Default   Message* ](#_bookmark402)below.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |  **Default Message**  The following default message is displayed when no reason is specified:  StopClient(WLError, \u201cClient\u201d+%d+\u201dwas terminated by a user command in  the script\u201d)  where %d is a parameter that takes the number of the client that was terminated. For example, \u201cClient 38 was terminated by a user command in the script\u201d.  **Examples**  `StopClient(WLError, \u201cError occurred when running script, client terminated\u201d)`  `StopClient(, \u201cError occurred when running script, client terminated\u201d)`  `StopClient(WLError)`  ## StopGenerator () (function)  **Description**  Stop the script from within the script.

A Synchronization Point is a meeting place where Virtual Clients wait before continuing with a script. When one Virtual Client arrives at a Synchronization Point, WebLOAD holds the Client at the point until all the other Virtual Clients arrive. When all the Virtual Clients have arrived, they are all released at once to perform the next action in the script simultaneously. For more information on Synchronization Points, see *Working with Synchronization Points* in the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide*.  **Syntax**  SynchronizationPoint([timeout])  **Parameters**  **Return Value**  SynchronizationPoint() functions return one of the following values. These values may be checked during the script runtime.  * WLSuccess \u2013 Synchronization succeeded. All Virtual Clients arrived at the Synchronization Point and were released together. * WLLoadChanged \u2013 Synchronization failed. A change in the Load Size was detected while Virtual Clients were being held at the Synchronization Point. All Virtual clients were released. * WLTimeout \u2013 Synchronization failed. The timeout expired before all Virtual Clients arrived at the Synchronization Point. All Virtual Clients were released. * WLError \u2013 Synchronization failed. Invalid timeout value. All Virtual Clients were released.  **Example**  The following script fragment illustrates a typical use of synchronization points. To test a Web application with all the Virtual Clients performing a particular Post operation simultaneously, add a Synchronization Point as follows. The various return values are highlighted:   <pre><code>wlHttp.Get(\u201curl\u201d)\n\n\u2026\n\nSP = SynchronizationPoint(10000) if (SP == **WLLoadChanged**)\n\n{\n\nInfoMessage(\u201cSyncronization failed, Load Size changed\u201d) InfoMessage(\u201cSP = \u201c + SP.toString() + \u201c \u201c + ClientNum)\n\n}\n\nif (SP == **WLTimeout**)\n\n{\n\nInfoMessage(\u201cSyncronization failed, Timeout expired\u201d) InfoMessage(\u201cSP = \u201c + SP.toString() + \u201c \u201c + ClientNum)\n\n}\n\nif (SP == **WLError**)\n\n{\n\nInfoMessage(\u201cSyncronization failed\u201d)\n\nInfoMessage(\u201cSP = \u201c + SP.toString() + \u201c \u201c + ClientNum)\n\n}\n\nif (SP == **WLSuccess**)\n\n{\n\nInfoMessage(\u201cSynchronization succeeded\u201d) InfoMessage(\u201cSP = \u201c + SP.toString() + \u201c \u201c+ ClientNum)\n\n}\n\nwlHttp.Post(url)\n</code></pre>   **GUI mode**  WebLOAD recommends setting synchronization functions within script files directly through the WebLOAD Recorder. Drag the **Synchronization Point**  icon from the Load toolbox into the Script Tree directly before the action you want all Virtual Clients to perform simultaneously. The **Synchronization Point** dialog box opens. Enter or select a timeout value for the Synchronization Point and click **OK**. The **Synchronization Point** item appears in the Script Tree and the JavaScript code is added to the script. The JavaScript code line that corresponds to the Synchronization Point in the Script Tree appears in the JavaScript View.  **Comment**  If there is a change in the Load Size (scheduled or unscheduled) or if any WebLOAD component is paused or stopped during the test session, all Synchronization Points are disabled.  Only client threads running within a single spawned process, on the same Load Generator, are able to share user-defined global variables and synchronization points. So if, for example, you have spawning set to 100 and you are running a total of 300 threads, realize that you are actually running three spawned processes on three separate Load Generators. You will therefore only be able to synchronize 100 client threads at a time, and not all 300.  **See also**  * SendCounter() (see [*SendCounter() (function)* ](#_bookmark343)on page [237](#_bookmark343)) * SendMeasurement() (see [*SendMeasurement() (function)* ](#_bookmark345)on page [238](#_bookmark345)) * SendTimer() (see [*SendTimer() (function)* ](#_bookmark348)on page [239](#_bookmark348)) * SetTimer() (see [*SetTimer() (function)* ](#_bookmark355)on page [244](#_bookmark355)) * Sleep() (see [*Sleep() (function)* ](#_bookmark363)on page [248](#_bookmark363)) * SynchronizationPoint() (see [*SynchronizationPoint() (function)* ](#_bookmark404)on page [277](#_bookmark404)) * [*Timing Functions* ](#_bookmark35)(on page [34](#_bookmark35))  ## tagName (property)  **Property of Object**  * cell (see [*cell (object)* ](#_bookmark49)on page [44](#_bookmark49))  **Description**  A string containing the cell type, either `` or ``.  **Syntax**  Use the following syntax to check a particular table cell type:  document.wlTables.myTable.cells[*index*#].tagName  **Comment**  The tagName property is a member of the wlTables family of table, row, and cell objects.  **See also**  * cell * cellIndex * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)) * cols (see [*cols (property)* ](#_bookmark64)on page [54](#_bookmark64)) (wlTables property) * Compare() (see [*Compare() (method)* ](#_bookmark65)on page [55](#_bookmark65)) * CompareColumns (see [*CompareColumns (property)* ](#_bookmark65)on page [55](#_bookmark65)) * CompareRows (see [*CompareRows (property)* ](#_bookmark65)on page [55](#_bookmark65)) * Details (see [*Details (property)* ](#_bookmark96)on page [76](#_bookmark96)) * id (see [*id (property)* ](#_bookmark208)on page [146](#_bookmark208)) (wlTables property) * InnerHTML (see [*InnerHTML (property)* ](#_bookmark219)on page [154](#_bookmark219)) (cell property) * InnerText (see [*InnerText (property)* ](#_bookmark223)on page [156](#_bookmark223)) (cell property) * MatchBy (see [*MatchBy (property)* ](#_bookmark246)on page [170](#_bookmark246)) * Prepare() (see [*Prepare() (method)* ](#_bookmark291)on page [208](#_bookmark291)) * ReportUnexpectedRows (see [*ReportUnexpectedRows (property)* ](#_bookmark310)on page [220](#_bookmark310)) * row (see [*row (object)* ](#_bookmark315)on page [223](#_bookmark315)) (wlTables property) * rowIndex (see [*rowIndex (property)* ](#_bookmark317)on page [224](#_bookmark317)) (row property) * wlTables (see [*wlTables (object)* ](#_bookmark493)on page [333](#_bookmark492))  ## target (property)  **Property of Object**  * form (see [*form (object)* ](#_bookmark125)on page [95](#_bookmark125)) * link (see [*link (object)* ](#_bookmark235)on page [162](#_bookmark235))  **Description**  The name of the window or frame into which the form or link should be downloaded (read-only string).  **Example**  In the following code fragment:  ` Go to New Page.`    The target property would equal \u201c_top\u201d and the link will load the page into the top frame of the current frameset.  **Comment**  While link and location objects share most of their properties, the target  property is used by the link object only and is not accessed by the location object.  The form.target and link.target properties identify the most recent, immediate location of the target frame using the name string or keyword that was assigned to that frame. Compare this to the wlHttp.wlTarget property of a transaction, which uses the WebLOAD shorthand notation, described in the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide*, to store the complete path of the frame, from the root window of the Web page. The last field of the wlHttp.wlTarget string is the target name stored in the form.target and link.target properties.  **See also**  * wlTarget (see [*wlTarget (property)* ](#_bookmark494)on page [334](#_bookmark494))  ## Text (function)  **Description**  Verify the absence or presence of a specified text expression within the Web server response.  **Syntax**  wlVerification.Text(searchOption, text, severity)  **Parameters**  | **Parameter  Name** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | searchOption              | Possible values are: WLFind or WLNotFind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | | text                      | String text to find in the  document.wlSource.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | | severity                  | Possible values of this parameter are:``WLSuccess.

This number is unique across the script\u2019s slave processes and is saved in the ClientNum property. Each client in a Load Generator is assigned a unique number. However, two clients in two different Load Generators may have the same number.   **Note:** While ClientNum is unique within a single Load Generator, it is not unique system wide. Use VCUniqueID() (see [*VCUniqueID() (function)* ](#_bookmark432)on page [296](#_bookmark432)) to obtain an ID number which is unique system-wide.  If there are N clients in a Load Generator, the clients are numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1. You can access ClientNum anywhere in the local context of the script  (InitClient(), main script, TerminateClient(), etc.). ClientNum does not exist in the global context (InitAgenda(), TerminateAgenda(), etc.).  If you mix scripts within a single Load Generator, instances of two or more scripts may run simultaneously on each client. Instances on the same client have the same ClientNum value.  ClientNum reports only the main client number. It does not report any extra threads spawned by a client to download nested images and frames (see [*LoadGeneratorThreads*](#_bookmark241) [*(property)* ](#_bookmark241)on page [165](#_bookmark240)).  **Comment**  Earlier versions of WebLOAD referred to this value as ThreadNum. The variable name  ThreadNum will still be recognized for backward compatibility.  **Example**  InfoMessage(\u201cThreadNum: \u201c + ThreadNum())  **See also**  * ClientNum() (see [*ClientNum (property)* ](#_bookmark60)on page [50](#_bookmark60)) * VCUniqueID (see [*VCUniqueID() (function)* ](#_bookmark433)on page [296](#_bookmark433))    ## TimeoutSeverity (property)  **Property of Objects**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object)  **Description**  When conducting Page Verification tests, TimeoutSeverity stores the error level to be triggered if the full set of verification tests requested for the current page are not completed within the specified time limit.  **GUI mode**  WebLOAD recommends setting page verification severity levels through the WebLOAD Console. Check Verification in the Page Time area and select an error severity level from the drop-down box in the Functional Testing tab of the **Default** or **Current Project Options** dialog box, accessed from the **Tools** tab of the ribbon.  **Syntax**  You may also assign a severity level using the TimeoutSeverity property.  wlGlobals.TimeoutSeverity = ErrorFlag  The following error codes are available:  * WLSuccess \u2013 The transaction terminated successfully. * WLMinorError \u2013 This specific transaction failed, but the test session may continue as usual.

When working with document objects, a title property is an object that contains the document title, stored as a text string. When working with window objects, the title is extracted from the document inside the window. title objects are local to a single thread. You cannot create new title objects using the JavaScript new operator, but you can access a document title through the properties and methods of the standard DOM objects. The properties of title are read-only.  When working with element, link, or location objects, a title property contains the title of the parent Button, Checkbox, Reset, or Submit element or link object. May be used as a tooltip string. When working with document objects, a title property is an object that contains the document title, stored as a text string. When working with window objects, the title is extracted from the document inside the window.  **Syntax**  **Document object:**  Access the title\u2019s properties directly using the following syntax:  document.title.``  **Example**  **Document object:**  CurrentDocumentTitle = document.title.string  **Properties**  **Document object:**  * string (see [*string (property)* ](#_bookmark405)on page [277](#_bookmark405))  **See also**  * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)) * form (see [*form (object)* ](#_bookmark125)on page [95](#_bookmark125)) * [*Select* ](#_bookmark329)(on page [230](#_bookmark329))    ## Title (function)  **Method of Object**  * wlVerification (see [*wlVerification (object)* ](#_bookmark497)on page [337](#_bookmark497))  **Description**  This function enables you to validate a HTML Web page\u2019s title.  **Syntax**  wlVerification.Title(``, ``\\ [, ``\\])  **Parameters**  | **Parameter  Name** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | ExpectedTitle             | A user-supplied string  that identifies the expected title of the HTML Web page.

Use the TransactionTime property to set a timeout limit for verification on the maximum transaction time.  **GUI mode**  WebLOAD recommends setting page verification timeout values through the WebLOAD Console. Check Page Verification and enter a maximum number of seconds in the Functional Testing tab of the **Default** or **Current Project Options** dialog box, accessed from the **Tools** tab of the ribbon.  **Syntax**  You may also assign a timeout value using the TransactionTime property.  `wlGlobals.TransactionTime = TimeValue`  **Example**  The value assigned to TransactionTime may be written in either string or integer format, where the integer represents the number of milliseconds to wait and the string represents the decimal fraction of a whole second.

If the parent is a form element object, then type holds the HTML type attribute of the form element. For example, an `` element can have a type of \u201cTEXT\u201d, \u201cCHECKBOX\u201d, or \u201cRADIO\u201d. Certain HTML form elements, such as `` do not have a type attribute. In that case, element.type is the element tag itself, for example \u201cSELECT\u201d.   **Note:** The Type value *does not* change. Even when working with dynamic HTML, the type of a specific object remains the same through all subsequent transactions with that object.  If the parent is a wlHttp.Data or wlHttp.DataFile object, then Type holds the MIME type of the string or form data being submitted through an HTTP Post command.  **Syntax**  element:  When working with element objects, use the lowercase form:    wlHttp.Data:  When working with wlHttp.Data objects, use the uppercase form:  wlHttp.Data.Type = \u201capplication/x-www-form-urlencoded\u201d  **Comment**  The Type property for wlHttp.Data and wlHttp.DataFile objects is written in uppercase.  **See also**  * Data (see [*Data (property)* ](#_bookmark80)on page [66](#_bookmark80)) * DataFile (see [*DataFile (property)* ](#_bookmark82)on page [67](#_bookmark82)) * Erase (see [*Erase (property)* ](#_bookmark113)on page [88](#_bookmark113)) * FileName (see [*FileName (property)* ](#_bookmark122)on page [93](#_bookmark122)) * FormData (see [*FormData (property)* ](#_bookmark127)on page [97](#_bookmark127)) * Get() (see [*Get() (transaction method)* ](#_bookmark136)on page [104](#_bookmark136)) * Header (see [*Header (property)* ](#_bookmark195)on page [140](#_bookmark195)) * Post() (see [*Post() (method)* ](#_bookmark290)on page [205](#_bookmark290)) * value (see [*value (property)* ](#_bookmark430)on page [294](#_bookmark430)) * wlClear() (see [*wlClear() (method)* ](#_bookmark440)on page [301](#_bookmark440)) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object)  ## Url (property)  **Property of Objects**  * element (see [*element (object)* ](#_bookmark102)on page [80](#_bookmark102)) * form (see [*form (object)* ](#_bookmark125)on page [95](#_bookmark125)) * frames (see [*frames (object)* ](#_bookmark129)on page [99](#_bookmark129)) * Image (see [*Image (object)* ](#_bookmark210)on page [149](#_bookmark210)) * link (see [*link (object)* ](#_bookmark235)on page [162](#_bookmark235)) * location (see [*location (object)* ](#_bookmark243)on page [168](#_bookmark243)) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object)  **Description**  Sets or retrieves the URL of the parent object on the Web page (read-only). If the parent object is of type ``, then this property holds the URL of the image element.  If the parent object is wlGlobals, this property holds the URL address to which the  wlGlobals object connects.  If the parent object is wlMetas, then if httpEquiv=\u201cREFRESH\u201d and the content property holds a URL, then the URL is extracted and stored in a link object (read- only).  **Example**  **Area, element, form, frame, image, link, location:**    **wlGlobals**:  wlGlobals.Url = [\u201chttp://www.ABCDEF.com](http://www.ABCDEF.com/)\u201d  **wlMetas**:  When working with wlMetas objects, use the all-uppercase caps form:  CurrentLink = document.wlMetas[0].URL  **Comment**  The URL property for area, element, form, frame, image, link, location, and  wlMetas objects is written in all-uppercase caps.  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * content (see [*content (property)* ](#_bookmark68)on page [56](#_bookmark68)) * httpEquiv (see [*httpEquiv (property)* ](#_bookmark204)on page [144](#_bookmark204)) * Name (see [*Name (property)* ](#_bookmark253)on page [174](#_bookmark253)) * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object) * wlMetas (see [*w*](#_bookmark471)[*lMetas (object)* ](#_bookmark471)on page [320](#_bookmark471))  ## UserAgent (property)  **Property of Objects**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  **Description**  A user agent is the client application used with a particular network protocol. The phrase, \u201cuser agent\u201d is most commonly used in reference to applications that access the World Wide Web. Web user agents range from web browsers to search engine crawlers (\u201cspiders\u201d), as well as mobile phones, etc. The user agent string can be sent as part of the HTTP request, prefixed with User-agent: or User-Agent:. This string typically includes information such as the application name, version, host, host operating system, and language. Some examples of user agent strings can be found at:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent#Example_user-agent_strings  The UserAgent property is used to define the user agent string for the scope of the WebLOAD object with which it is associated.  **GUI mode**  WebLOAD recommends setting user agent values through the WebLOAD Console. Select a browser type and user agent through the Browser Parameters tab of the **Default** or **Current Project Options** dialog box, accessed from the **Tools** tab of the ribbon.  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21))  ## UserName (property)  **Property of Objects**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  **Description**  The user name that the script uses to log onto a restricted HTTP site. WebLOAD automatically uses the appropriate access protocol. For example, if a site expects clients  to use the NT Authentication protocol, the appropriate user name and password will be stored and sent accordingly.  **GUI mode**  WebLOAD by default senses the appropriate authentication configuration settings for the current test session.  If you prefer to explicitly set authentication values, WebLOAD recommends setting user authentication values through the WebLOAD Console. Enter user authentication information through the Authentication tab of the **Default** or **Current Session Options** dialog box, accessed from the **Tools** tab of the ribbon.  **Syntax**  You may also set user values using the wlGlobals properties. WebLOAD automatically sends the user name and password when a wlHttp object connects to an HTTP site. For example:  wlGlobals.UserName = \u201cBill\u201d  wlGlobals.PassWord = \u201cTopSecret\u201d  **Comments**  A user is only authenticated once during a round with a set of credentials. Each subsequent request will use these credentials regardless of what is contained in the script. If the value of these credentials are changed after authentication, they will only be used during the next round, not during the current round.  For example, if you are trying to send a request to a URL with a group of users (user1, user2, and user3), but user1 has already been authenticated, the login is always performed for user1 until the round is complete.  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * NTUserName, NTPassWord (see [*NTUserName, NTPassWord (properties)* ](#_bookmark255)on page [176](#_bookmark255))  ## UseSameProxyForSSL (property)  **Property of Objects**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)  **Description**  The UseSameProxyForSSL property can have one of the following values:  * **false** (default value) \u2013 The engine uses the Proxy, ProxyUserName, ProxyPassWord, ProxyNTUserName, and ProxyNTPassWord properties for both SSL and non-SSL traffic. * **true** \u2013 The engine uses the Proxy, ProxyUserName, ProxyPassWord, ProxyNTUserName, and ProxyNTPassWord properties for non-SSL traffic and the HttpsProxy, HttpsProxyUserName, HttpsProxyPassWord, HttpsProxyNTUserName, and HttpsNTPassWord properties for SSL traffic.  This property is used when you are working with a separate SSL proxy.   **Note:** This property can only be inserted manually.  **Example** wlGlobals.UseSameProxyForSSL = false **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * *Security* in the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide* * HttpsProxy, HttpsProxyUserName, HttpsProxyPassWord (see [*HttpsProxy,*](#_bookmark206)[ *HttpsProxyUserName, HttpsProxyPassWord (properties)* ](#_bookmark206)on page [145](#_bookmark206)) * HttpsProxyNTUserName, HttpsProxyNTPassWord (see [*HttpsProxyNTUserName,*](#_bookmark207)[ *HttpsProxyNTPassWord (properties)* ](#_bookmark207)on page [146](#_bookmark207))    ## UsingTimer (property)  **Property of Object**  * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object)  **Description**  The name of a timer to use for the Get() or Post() method.  **Example**  WebLOAD zeros the timer immediately before a Get() or Post() call and sends the timer value to the WebLOAD Console immediately after the call. This is equivalent to calling the SetTimer() and SendTimer() functions. Thus the following two code examples are equivalent:  //**Version 1**  `wlHttp.UsingTimer = \u201cTimer1\u201d`  `wlHttp.Get(\u201chttp://www.ABCDEF.com](http://www.ABCDEF.com/)\u201d)`  //**Version 2**  `SetTimer(\u201cTimer1\u201d) [wlHttp.Get(\u201chttp://www.ABCDEF.com](http://www.ABCDEF.com/)\u201d)`   `SendTimer(\u201cTimer1\u201d)`  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * SendTimer() (see [*SendTimer() (function)* ](#_bookmark348)on page [239](#_bookmark348)) * SetTimer() (see [*SetTimer() (function)* ](#_bookmark355)on page [244](#_bookmark355))    ## value (property)  **Property of Objects**  * element (see [*element (object)* ](#_bookmark102)on page [80](#_bookmark102)) * option (see [*option (object)* ](#_bookmark264)on page [185](#_bookmark264)) * wlHeaders (see [*wlHeaders (object)* ](#_bookmark462)on page [314](#_bookmark461)) * wlHttp.Data (see [*Data (property)* ](#_bookmark80)on page [66](#_bookmark80)) * wlHttp.Header (see [*Header (property)* ](#_bookmark195)on page [140](#_bookmark195)) * wlSearchPairs (see [*wlSearchPairs (object)* ](#_bookmark480)on page [327](#_bookmark481))  **Description**  Sets and retrieves the value associated with the parent object.  When working with elements or options, this property holds the text associated with this object. This is the value that is returned to the server when a FORM control of type Button, Checkbox, Radiobutton, Reset, or Submit is submitted. Thus the value property holds the HTML value attribute of the object (the `` element). If the element does not have a value attribute, WebLOAD sets the value property equal to the text property.  When working with wlHeaders or wlSearchPairs objects, this property holds the value of the search key.  When working with wlHttp.Data or wlHttp.Header objects, this property holds the value of the data string being submitted through an HTTP Post command.  **Syntax**  **For elements and options:**    **For wlHeaders:**  `document.wlHeaders[*index#*].value = \u201cTextString\u201d`  For example:  `document.wlHeaders[0].value = \u201cNetscape-Enterprise/3.0F\u201d`  **For wlSearchPairs:**  `document.links[1].wlSearchPairs[*index#*].value = \u201cTextString\u201d`  For example:  `document.links[1].wlSearchPairs[0].value = \u201cOpticsResearch\u201d`  **For wlHttp.Header:**  `wlHttp.Header[\u201cvalue\u201d] = \u201cTextString\u201d`  **For wlHttp.Data:**  When working with wlHttp.Data objects, use the uppercase form:  `wlHttp.Data.Value = \u201cSearchFor=icebergs&amp;SearchType=ExactTerm\u201d`  **Comment**  The Value property for element and wlHttp.Data objects is written in uppercase.  **See also**  * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)) * Data (see [*Data (property)* ](#_bookmark80)on page [66](#_bookmark80)) * DataFile (see [*DataFile (property)* ](#_bookmark82)on page [67](#_bookmark82)) * element (see [*element (object)* ](#_bookmark102)on page [80](#_bookmark102)) * Erase (see [*Erase (property)* ](#_bookmark113)on page [88](#_bookmark113)) * FileName (see [*FileName (property)* ](#_bookmark122)on page [93](#_bookmark122)) * form (see [*form (object)* ](#_bookmark125)on page [95](#_bookmark125)) * FormData (see [*FormData (property)* ](#_bookmark127)on page [97](#_bookmark127)) * Get() (see [*Get() (transaction method)* ](#_bookmark136)on page [104](#_bookmark136)) * Header (see [*Header (property)* ](#_bookmark195)on page [140](#_bookmark195)) * Image (see [*Image (object)* ](#_bookmark210)on page [149](#_bookmark210)) * key (see [*key (property)* ](#_bookmark229)on page [160](#_bookmark229)) * option (see [*option (object)* ](#_bookmark264)on page [185](#_bookmark264)) * Post() (see [*Post() (method)* ](#_bookmark290)on page [205](#_bookmark290)) * [*Select* ](#_bookmark329)(on page [230](#_bookmark329)) * type (see [*type (property)* ](#_bookmark420)on page [288](#_bookmark420)) * value (see [*value (property)* ](#_bookmark430)on page [294](#_bookmark430)) * wlClear() (see [*wlClear() (method)* ](#_bookmark440)on page [301](#_bookmark440)) * wlHeaders (see [*wlHeaders (object)* ](#_bookmark462)on page [314](#_bookmark461)) * wlHttp (see [*wlHttp (object)* ](#_bookmark465)on page [316](#_bookmark465)) * wlSearchPairs (see [*wlSearchPairs (object)* ](#_bookmark480)on page [327](#_bookmark481))    ## VCUniqueID() (function)  **Description**  VCUniqueID() provides a unique identification for the current Virtual Client instance which is unique system-wide, across multiple Load Generators, even with multiple spawned processes running simultaneously. Compare this to ClientNum (see [*ClientNum (variable)* ](#_bookmark60)on page [50](#_bookmark60)), which provides an identification number that is only unique within a single Load Generator. The identification string is composed of a concatenation of the script name, Load Generator name, current thread number, and round number.  **Syntax**   VCUniqueID()     **Return Value**  Returns a unique identification string for the current Virtual Client instance.  **Example**  InfoMessage(VCUniqueID())  The results are  [j@chaimsh.0.1](mailto:j@chaimsh.0.1)  where:  * j is the name of the script. * chaimsh is the name of the Load Generator. * 0 is the client number. * 1 is the round number.  **See also**  * ClientNum (see [*ClientNum (variable)* ](#_bookmark60)on page [50](#_bookmark60)) * GeneratorName() (see [*GeneratorName() (function)* ](#_bookmark131)on page [101](#_bookmark131)) * GetOperatingSystem() (see [*GetOperatingSystem() (function)* ](#_bookmark176)on page [131](#_bookmark176)) * [*Identification Variables and Functions* ](#_bookmark28)(on page [29](#_bookmark28)) * RoundNum (see [*RoundNum (variable)* ](#_bookmark314)on page [222](#_bookmark314))  ## VerificationFunction() (user-defined) (function)  **Description**  User-defined verification function to be used with a \u2018named\u2019 transaction. A function written by the user, tailored to the specific testing and verification needs of the application being tested.  **Syntax**  UserDefinedVerificationFunction(specified by user)   <pre><code>{\n\n\u2026\n\n`&lt;any valid JavaScript code&gt;` return value\n\n}\n</code></pre>   **Parameters**  Specified by user.  **Return Value**  The user-defined Verification() function returns a value based on user-specified criterion. You define the success and failure criterion for user-defined transactions. You also determine the severity level of any failures. The severity level determines the execution path when the main script resumes control. Less severe failures may be noted and ignored. More severe failures may cause the whole test to be aborted.  Set the severity level in the verification function return statement. All failures are logged and displayed in the Log Window, similar to any other WebLOAD test failure. Refer to the *WebLOAD Console User\u2019s Guide* for more information on return values and error codes. Transactions may be assigned one of the following return values:  * WLSuccess \u2013 The transaction terminated successfully. * WLMinorError \u2013 This specific transaction failed, but the test session may continue as usual. The script displays a warning message in the Log window and continues execution from the next statement. * WLError \u2013 This specific transaction failed and the current test round was aborted. The script displays an error message in the Log window. If you are working with  WebLOAD, a new round is begun only if WebLOAD is configured for multiple iterations.  * WLSevereError \u2013 This specific transaction failed and the test session must be stopped completely. The script displays an error message in the Log window. If you are working with WebLOAD Recorder, the test session is stopped. If you are working with WebLOAD, the Load Generator on which the error occurred is stopped.  The default return value is WLSuccess. If no other return value is specified for the transaction, the default assumption is that the transaction terminated successfully.  **Example**  The following sample verification function checks if the current title of the Web  page matches the page title expected at this point. (In this case, the function looks for a match with a Google page.)   <pre><code>function Transaction1_VerificationFunction()\n\n{\n\nInfoMessage(document.title) if(document.title.indexOf(\u201cGoogle\u201d)&gt;0)\n\nreturn WLSuccess else\n\nreturn WLMinorError\n\n}\n</code></pre>   **Comment**  All functions must be declared in the script before they can be called.

Current supported versions include 1.0 and 1.1.  **GUI mode**  WebLOAD recommends selecting an HTTP version through the WebLOAD Console. Click the appropriate version number radio button in the HTTP Parameters tab of the **Default** or **Current Session Options** dialog box, accessed from the **Tools** tab of the ribbon.  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21))  ## WarningMessage() (function)  **Description**  Use this function to display a warning message in the Log window.    **Syntax**   WarningMessage(msg) ****  **Comment**  If you call WarningMessage() in the main script, WebLOAD sends a warning message to the Log window and continues with script execution as usual. The message has no impact on the continued execution of the test session.  **GUI mode**  WebLOAD recommends adding message functions to your script files directly through the WebLOAD Recorder. Drag the Message icon from the WebLOAD Recorder toolbox  into the script. The Message dialog box opens. Enter the message text, select the WLMinorError severity level for the message, and click **OK**.  **See also**  * ErrorMessage() (see [*ErrorMessage() (function)* ](#_bookmark115)on page [90](#_bookmark115)) * GetMessage() (see [*GetMessage() (method)* ](#_bookmark172)on page [129](#_bookmark172)) * GetSeverity() (see [*GetSeverity() (method)* ](#_bookmark182)on page [134](#_bookmark182)) * InfoMessage() (see [*InfoMessage() (function)* ](#_bookmark217)on page [153](#_bookmark217)) * [*Message Functions* ](#_bookmark29)(on page [30](#_bookmark29)) * ReportLog() (see [*ReportLog() (method)* ](#_bookmark308)on page [219](#_bookmark308)) * SevereErrorMessage() (see [*SevereErrorMessage() (function)* ](#_bookmark359)on page [246](#_bookmark359)) * [*Using the IntelliSense JavaScript Editor* ](#_bookmark18)(on page [18](#_bookmark18)) * wlException (see [*wlException (object)* ](#_bookmark446)on page [306](#_bookmark446)) * wlException() (see [*wlException() (constructor)* ](#_bookmark448)on page [308](#_bookmark448))    ## window (object)  **Property of Object**  * frames (see [*frames (object)* ](#_bookmark129)on page [99](#_bookmark129))  **Description**  The window object represents an open browser window. window objects store the complete parse results for downloaded HTML pages. Use the window object to gain access to the document in the window. From the window properties you can retrieve the document itself, check the location, and access other subframes that are nested within that window. Typically, the browser creates a single window object when it opens an HTML document. However, if a document defines one or more frames the browser creates one window object for the original document and one additional window object (a *child window*) for each frame. The child window may be affected by actions that occur in the parent. For example, closing the parent window causes all child windows to close.   **Note:** The 'parent' window item is usually implicitly understood when accessing the HTML document information.  window objects are also accessed through nested frames, where the frame object's  window property points to a child window nested within the given frame (read-only).  **Example**  When working with multiple child windows of a frames collection, access the first child window using the following expressions:  `frames[0]`  -Or-  `document.`frames[0]``  Access the properties (document, location, or frames) of the first child window with the following expressions:  `frames[0]`.``  -Or-  `document.`frames[0]``.&lt;*child-property*&gt;  For example:  `frames[0]`.location  -Or-  `document.`frames[0]``.location  **Properties**  * document (see [*document (object)* ](#_bookmark100)on page [78](#_bookmark100)) * location (see [*location (object)* ](#_bookmark244)on page [168](#_bookmark244)) * Name (see [*Name (property)* ](#_bookmark253)on page [174](#_bookmark253)) * title (see [*title (property)* ](#_bookmark415)on page [355](#_bookmark415)) * Url (see [*Url (property)* ](#_bookmark422)on page [363](#_bookmark422))  **See also**  * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23))  ## wlClear() (method)  **Method of Objects**  The wlHttp object includes the following collections for storing data. These data storage collections each include the method wlClear().  * wlHttp.Data (see [*Data (property)* ](#_bookmark80)on page [66](#_bookmark80)) * wlHttp.DataFile (see [*DataFile (property)* ](#_bookmark82)on page [67](#_bookmark82)) * wlHttp.FormData (see [*FormData (property)* ](#_bookmark127)on page [97](#_bookmark127)) * wlHttp.Header (see [*Header (property)* ](#_bookmark195)on page [140](#_bookmark195))  **Description**  wlClear() is used to clear property values from the specified wlHttp data collection.  **Syntax**  wlHttp.*DataCollection*.wlClear([FieldName])  **Parameters**  [FieldName]-An optional user-supplied string with the name of the field to be cleared.  **Example**  If called with no parameters, then all values set for the collection are cleared:  wlHttp.FormData[\u201ca\u201d] = \u201cDDD\u201d wlHttp.FormData[\u201cB\u201d] = \u201cFFF\u201d wlHttp.FormData.wlClear()  // Clear all value from all fields in FormData InfoMessage (wlHttp.FormData[\u201ca\u201d])  // This statement has no meaning, since there  // is currently no value assigned to \u201ca\u201d  If wlClear() is passed a FieldName parameter, then only the value of the specified field is cleared:  wlHttp.FormData.wlClear(\u201cFirstName\u201d)  // Clears only value assigned to \u201cFirstName\u201d  **See also**  * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)) * Data (see [*Data (property)* ](#_bookmark80)on page [66](#_bookmark80)) * DataFile (see [*DataFile (property)* ](#_bookmark82)on page [67](#_bookmark82)) * FormData (see [*FormData (property)* ](#_bookmark127)on page [97](#_bookmark127)) * Header (see [*Header (property)* ](#_bookmark195)on page [140](#_bookmark195)) * wlHttp (see [*wlHttp (object)* ](#_bookmark465)on page [316](#_bookmark465))  ## wlCookie (object)  **Description**  The wlCookie object gets, sets and deletes cookies. These activities may be required by an HTTP server.   **Note:** Cookie management is usually handled automatically through the standard DOM document.cookie property.  WebLOAD supports the wlCookie object as an alternate approach to cookie management. You may use the methods of wlCookie to create as many cookies as needed. For example, each WebLOAD client running a script can set its own cookie identified by a unique name. wlCookie is a local object. WebLOAD automatically creates an independent wlCookie object for each thread of a script. You cannot manually declare wlCookie objects yourself.  By default, WebLOAD always accepts cookies that are sent from a server. When WebLOAD connects to a server, it automatically submits any cookies in the server\u2019s domain that it has stored. The wlCookie object lets you supplement or override this behavior in the following ways:  * A thread can create its own cookies. * A thread can delete cookies that it created. * A thread can get the value of a cookie that is created.  Aside from these two abilities, WebLOAD does not distinguish in any way between cookies that it receives from a server and those that you create yourself. For example, if a thread creates a cookie in a particular domain, it automatically submits the cookie when it connects to any server in the domain.   **Note:** This property can only be inserted manually.  **Syntax** wlCookie.*method()* **Example**  //Set a cookie  wlCookie.Set(\u201cCUSTOMER\u201d, \u201cJOHN_SMITH\u201d, [\u201cwww.ABCDEF.com](http://www.ABCDEF.com/)\u201d, \u201c/\u201d, \u201cWed, 08-Apr-98 17:29:00 GMT\u201d)  //WebLOAD submits the cookie [wlHttp.Get(\u201cwww.ABCDEF.com/products/OrderForm.cgi](http://www.ABCDEF.com/products/OrderForm.cgi)\u201d)  //Get the value of a cookie  retValue = wlCookie.Get(\u201cCUSTOMER\u201d, \u201c[www.ABCDEF.com](http://www.abcdef.com/)\u201d, \u201c/\u201d )  //Delete the cookie wlCookie.ClearAll()  **Methods**  * ClearAll() (see [*ClearAll() (method)* ](#_bookmark54)on page [48](#_bookmark54)) * Delete() (see [*D*](#_bookmark93)[*elete() (cookie method)* ](#_bookmark93)on page [75](#_bookmark95)) * Set() (see [*Set() (cookie method)* ](#_bookmark351)on page [241](#_bookmark351)) * Get() (see [*Get() (cookie method)* ](#_bookmark135)on page [103](#_bookmark135))  ## wlDataFileField (method)  **Description**  WLDataFileField creates the data file field parameter.  **Syntax**  fileFieldParam = WLDataFileField(paramName, ColumnNumber);  **Parameters**  | **Parameter  Name** | **Description**                           | | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | | paramName                 | File parameter ID, returned by WLDataFileParam. | | ColumnNumber              | File column number.                             |    ## wlDataFileParam() (parameterization)  **Description**  Define a data file parameter.  **Syntax**  `` = wlDataFileParam(FileID, CopyFileId, HeaderLines, Delimiter, AccessMethod, Scope, UsageMethod, EndOfFileBehavior);  **Parameters**  | **Parameter  Name** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | FileID                    | A string which is a unique parameter  identifier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | | CopyFileId                | An identifier which refers  to the local file.

This would not be helpful to testers who are trying to analyze when, where, and why an error in their application occurs. WebLOAD scripts incorporate a set of error management routines to provide a robust error logging and recovery mechanism whenever possible. The wlException object is part of the WebLOAD error management protocol.  WebLOAD users have a variety of options for error recovery during a test session. The built-in error flags provide the simplest set of options; an informative message, a simple warning, stop the current round and skip to the beginning of the next round, or stop the test session completely. Users may also use try()/catch() commands to enclose logical blocks of code within a round. This provides the option of catching any minor errors that occur within the enclosed block and continuing with the next logical block of code within the current round, rather than skipping the rest of the round completely.  Users may add their own try()/catch() pairs to a script, delimiting their own logical code blocks and defining their own alternate set of activities to be executed in case an error occurs within that block. If an error is caught while the script is in the middle of executing the code within a protected logical code block (by try()),  WebLOAD will detour to a user-defined error function (the catch() block) and then continue execution with the next navigation block in the script.  wlException objects store information about errors that have occurred, including informative message strings and error severity levels. Users writing error recovery functions to handle the errors caught within a try()/catch() pair may utilize the wlException object. Use the wlException methods to perhaps send error messages to the Log Window or trigger a system error of the specified severity level.  **Example**  The following code fragment illustrates a typical error-handling routine:   <pre><code>try{\n\n...\n\n//do a lot of things\n\n...\n\n//error occurs here\n\n...\n\n}\n\ncatch(e){\n\nmyException = new wlException(e,\u201cwe have a problem\u201d)\n\n//things to do in case of error\n\nif (myException.GetSeverity() == WLError) {\n\n// Do one set of Error activities myException.ReportLog()\n\nthrow myException\n\n}\n\nelse {\n\n// Do a different set of Severe Error activities throw myException\n\n}\n\n}\n</code></pre>   **Methods**  * GetMessage() (see [*GetMessage() (method)* ](#_bookmark172)on page [129](#_bookmark172)) * GetSeverity() (see [*GetSeverity() (method)* ](#_bookmark182)on page [134](#_bookmark182)) * ReportLog() (see [*ReportLog() (method)* ](#_bookmark308)on page [219](#_bookmark308)) * wlException() (see [*wlException() (constructor)* ](#_bookmark448)on page [308](#_bookmark448))  **See also**  * ErrorMessage() (see [*ErrorMessage() (function)* ](#_bookmark115)on page [90](#_bookmark115)) * InfoMessage() (see [*InfoMessage() (function)* ](#_bookmark217)on page [153](#_bookmark217)) * [*Message Functions* ](#_bookmark29)(on page [30](#_bookmark29)) * SevereErrorMessage() (see [*SevereErrorMessage() (function)* ](#_bookmark359)on page [246](#_bookmark359)) * [*Using the IntelliSense JavaScript Editor* ](#_bookmark18)(on page [18](#_bookmark18)) * WarningMessage() (see [*WarningMessage() (function)* ](#_bookmark437)on page [299](#_bookmark437))    ## wlException() (constructor)  **Method of Object**  * wlException (see [*wlException (object)* ](#_bookmark446)on page [306](#_bookmark446))  **Description**  Creates a new wlException object.  **Syntax**  NewExceptionObject = new wlException(severity, message)  **Parameters**  | **Parameter Name** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | severity                 | One of the following integer constants:``WLError.

The wlGeneratorGlobal object enables sharing of global variables and values between all threads of a single Load Generator, even when running multiple scripts. (Compare to the wlSystemGlobal (see [*wlSystemGlobal (object)* ](#_bookmark491)on page [332](#_bookmark490))object, which enables sharing of global variables and values system-wide, between all threads of all Load Generators participating in a test session, and to the [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) object, which enables sharing of global variables and values between threads of a single script, running on a single Load Generator.)  Globally shared variables are useful when tracking a value or maintaining a count across multiple threads or platforms. For example, you may include these shared values in the messages sent to the Log window during a test session.  WebLOAD creates exactly one wlGeneratorGlobal object for each Load Generator participating in a test session. Use the wlGeneratorGlobal methods to create and access variable values that you wish to share between threads of a Load Generator.  Edit wlGeneratorGlobal properties and methods through the IntelliSense editor, described in [*Using the IntelliSense JavaScript Editor* ](#_bookmark18)(on page [18](#_bookmark18)). While global variables may be accessed anywhere in your script, be sure to initially declare wlGeneratorGlobal values in the InitAgenda() *function only*. Do not define new values within the main body of a Script, for they will not be shared correctly by all threads.  **Methods**  The wlGeneratorGlobal object includes the following methods:  * Add() (see [*Add() (method)* ](#_bookmark45)on page [39](#_bookmark43)) * Get() (see [*Get() (addition method)* ](#_bookmark134)on page [102](#_bookmark134)) * Set() (see [*Set() (addition method)* ](#_bookmark350)on page [240](#_bookmark350))  **Properties**  wlGeneratorGlobal incorporates a dynamic property set that consists of whatever global variables have been defined, set, and accessed by the user through the wlGeneratorGlobal method set only.  **See also**  * wlSystemGlobal (see [*wlSystemGlobal (object)* ](#_bookmark491)on page [332](#_bookmark490))    ## wlGet() (method)  **Method of Object**  Each of the different types of collections of elements found in the parsed DOM tree includes the method wlGet().  **Description**  wlGet() is used when getting data from a property in the collection to distinguish between keywords and user-defined variables that share the same names. The need for this care is explained in this section.    **Syntax**   *Collection*.wlGet(PropertyName)   **Return Value**  The value of the specified property  **Example**   `document.forms[0].elements.wlGet(\u201cFirstName\u201d)`   **Comment**  In JavaScript, users may work interchangeably with either an array[index] or  array.index notation. For example, the following two references are interchangeable:  `wlHttp.FormData[\u201cSunday\u201d]`  -Or-  `wlHttp.FormData.Sunday`  This flexibility is convenient for programmers, who are able to select the syntax that is most appropriate for the context. However, it could potentially lead to ambiguity. For example, assume a website included a form with a field called length. This could lead to a confusing situation, where the word length appearing in a script could represent either the number of elements in a FormData array, as explained in length, or the value of the length field in the form. Errors would arise from a reasonable assignment statement such as:  wlHttp.FormData[\u201clength\u201d] = 7  This is equivalent to the illegal assignment statement:  wlHttp.FormData.length = 7  WebLOAD therefore uses wlGet() to retrieve field data whenever the name could lead to potential ambiguity. When recording scripts with WebLOAD Recorder, WebLOAD recognizes potential ambiguities and inserts the appropriate wlGet() statements automatically.  **See also**  * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)) * wlHttp (see [*wlHttp (object)* ](#_bookmark465)on page [316](#_bookmark465))    ## wlGetAllForms() (method)  **Method of Object**  * document (see [*document (object)* ](#_bookmark100)on page [78](#_bookmark100))  **Description**  Retrieve a collection of all forms (`` elements) in an HTML page and its nested frames.  **Syntax**   wlGetAllForms()   **Return Value**  A collection that includes the forms in the top-level frame (from which you called the  method) and all its subframes at any level of nesting.  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21))  ## wlGetAllFrames() (method)  **Method of Object**  * document (see [*document (object)* ](#_bookmark100)on page [78](#_bookmark100))  **Description**  Retrieve a collection of all frames in an HTML page, at any level of nesting.  **Syntax** wlGetAllFrames() **Return Value**  A collection that includes the top-level frame (from which you called the method) and  all its subframes.  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21))  ## wlGetAllLinks() (method)  **Method of Object**  * document (see [*document (object)* ](#_bookmark100)on page [78](#_bookmark100))  **Description**  Retrieve a collection of all links (`` elements) in an HTML page and its nested frames.  **Syntax** wlGetAllLinks() **Return Value**  A collection that includes links in the top-level frame (from which you called the  method) and all its subframes at any level of nesting.  **See also**  * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21))  ## wlGlobals (object)  **Description**  The wlGlobals object stores the default global configuration properties set by the user through the WebLOAD Recorder or Console, including properties defining expected dialog boxes, verification test selections, and dynamic state management.  wlGlobals is a global object, whose property values are shared by all threads of a script running on a single Load Generator. The wlGlobals object enables sharing of user-defined global variables and values between threads of a single script, running on a single Load Generator. (Compare to the wlGeneratorGlobal (see [*w*](#_bookmark450)[*lGeneratorGlobal*](#_bookmark450) [*(object)* ](#_bookmark450)on page [309](#_bookmark450)) object, which enables sharing of global variables and values between all threads of a single Load Generator, and the wlSystemGlobal (see [*wlSystemGlobal (object)* ](#_bookmark491)on page [332](#_bookmark490)) object, which enables sharing of global variables and values system-wide, between all threads of all Load Generators participating in a test session.)   **Note:** Most global configuration property values and user-defined variables should be set through the WebLOAD Recorder or Console. The property descriptions here are intended mainly to explain the lines of code seen in the JavaScript View of the WebLOAD Recorder desktop. Syntax details are also provided for the benefit of users who prefer to manually edit the JavaScript code of their scripts through the IntelliSense editor, described in [*Using the IntelliSense JavaScript Editor* ](#_bookmark18)(on page [18](#_bookmark18)). If you do decide to edit the global variable values in your script, set wlGlobals properties in the InitAgenda() *function only*. Do not define new values within the main body of a script. The values will not be shared correctly by all script threads.  The configuration properties of the wlGlobals object are almost all duplicated in the wlLocals (see [*wlLocals (object)* ](#_bookmark469)on page [319](#_bookmark469)), which contains the local configuration settings for browser actions, and in the wlHttp (see [*wlHttp (object)* ](#_bookmark465)on page [316](#_bookmark465)), which contains configuration settings that are limited to a single specific browser action. To understand how there could potentially be three different settings for a single configuration property, see the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide*.  **Properties**  The wlGlobals object includes the following property classes:  * *Automatic State Management for HTTP Protocol Mode* (on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * [*Transaction Verification Components* ](#_bookmark39)(on page [36](#_bookmark38))  **Syntax**  Each individual property class includes the syntax specifications that apply to that class.  **GUI mode**  The wlGLobals, property and method descriptions explain how to explicitly set values for these session configuration properties within your JavaScript script files.  The recommended way to set configuration values is through the WebLOAD Recorder, using the Default, Current, and Global Options dialog boxes accessed from the **Tools** tab in the Console desktop ribbon. The dialog boxes provide a means of defining and setting configuration values with ease, simplicity, and clarity.  **See also**  * wlHttp (see [wlHttp (object) ](#_bookmark465)on page [316](#_bookmark465)) * wlGeneratorGlobal (see [*w*](#_bookmark450)[*lGeneratorGlobal (object)* ](#_bookmark450)on page [309](#_bookmark450)) * wlLocals (see [*wlLocals (object)* ](#_bookmark469)on page [319](#_bookmark469)) * wlSystemGlobal (see [*wlSystemGlobal (object)* ](#_bookmark491)on page [332](#_bookmark490))    ## wlHeaders (object)  **Property of Objects**  Headers on a Web page are accessed through wlHeaders objects that are grouped into collections of wlHeaders. The wlHeaders collection is a property of the following objects:  * document (see [*document (object)* ](#_bookmark100)on page [78](#_bookmark100))  **Description**  Each wlHeaders object contains a key-value pair. wlHeaders objects provide access to the key/value pairs in the HTTP *response headers*. (Information found in *request headers* is available through the wlHttp.Header property. For key-value pairs found in *URL search strings*, see [*wlSearchPairs (object)* ](#_bookmark480)(on page [327](#_bookmark481)).)  wlHeaders objects are local to a single thread. You cannot create new wlHeaders objects using the JavaScript new operator, but you can access them through the properties and methods of the standard DOM objects. wlHeaders properties are read only.  **Syntax**  wlHeaders objects are grouped together within collections of wlHeaders. To access an individual wlHeaders\u2019s properties, check the length property of the wlHeaders collection and use an index number to access the individual wlHeaders object, with the following syntax:  NumberofHeaderObjects = document.wlHeaders.length document.wlHeaders[*index*#].&lt;*wlHeaders-property*&gt;  **Example**  WebLOAD stores the header pairs from the response to the most recent Get, Post, or Head command in the document.wlHeaders collection. The following statement would retrieve an HTTP header:  wlHttp.Head(\u201c[http://www.ABCDEF.com](http://www.ABCDEF.com/)\u201d)  For a header that looks something like this:  HTTP/1.1 200 OK  Server: Netscape-Enterprise/3.0F Date: Sun, 11 Jan 1998 08:25:20 GMT  Content-type: text/html Connection: close  Host: Server2.MyCompany.com  WebLOAD parses the header pairs as follows:  document.wlHeaders[0].key = \u201cServer\u201d document.wlHeaders[0].value = \u201cNetscape-Enterprise/3.0F\u201d document.wlHeaders[1].key = \u201cDate\u201d document.wlHeaders[1].value = \u201cSun, 11 Jan 1998 08:25:20 GMT\u201d  ...  **Properties**  The wlHeaders object includes the following properties:  * key (see [*key (property)* ](#_bookmark229)on page [160](#_bookmark229)) * value (see [*value (property)* ](#_bookmark430)on page [294](#_bookmark430))  **See also**  * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)) * Header (see [*Header (property)* ](#_bookmark195)on page [140](#_bookmark195)) * wlSearchPairs (see [*wlSearchPairs (object)* ](#_bookmark480)on page [327](#_bookmark481))    ## wlHtml (object)  **Description**  If your script downloads HTML code, you can use the wlHtml object to retrieve parsed elements of the code. The wlHtml object also lets you retrieve the HTTP header fields and status and parse URL addresses into their host, port, and URI components.  wlHtml is a local object. WebLOAD automatically creates an independent wlHtml object for each thread of a script. You cannot manually declare wlHtml objects yourself.  **Methods**  * GetFieldValue() (see [*GetFieldValue() (method)* ](#_bookmark146)on page [113](#_bookmark146)) * GetFieldValueInForm() (see [*GetFieldValueInForm() (method)* ](#_bookmark147)on page [114](#_bookmark147)) * GetFormAction() (see [*GetFormAction() (method)* ](#_bookmark149)on page [115](#_bookmark149)) * GetFrameByUrl() (see [*GetFrameByUrl() (method)* ](#_bookmark152)on page [116](#_bookmark152)) * GetFrameUrl() (see [*GetFrameUrl() (method)* ](#_bookmark154)on page [117](#_bookmark154)) * GetHeaderValue() (see [*GetHeaderValue() (method)* ](#_bookmark156)on page [118](#_bookmark156)) * GetHost() (see [*GetHost() (method)* ](#_bookmark158)on page [119](#_bookmark158)) * GetHostName() (see [*GetHostName() (method)* ](#_bookmark160)on page [120](#_bookmark160)) * GetLinkByName() (see [*GetLinkByName() (method)* ](#_bookmark168)on page [127](#_bookmark168)) * GetLinkByUrl() (see [*GetLinkByUrl() (method)* ](#_bookmark170)on page [128](#_bookmark170)) * GetPortNum() (see [*GetPortNum() (method)* ](#_bookmark178)on page [132](#_bookmark178)) * GetQSFieldValue() (see [*GetQSFieldValue() (method)* ](#_bookmark180)on page [133](#_bookmark180)) * GetStatusLine() (see [*GetStatusLine() (method)* ](#_bookmark185)on page [135](#_bookmark185)) * GetStatusNumber() (see [*GetStatusNumber() (method)* ](#_bookmark187)on page [136](#_bookmark187)) * GetUri() (see [*GetUri() (method)* ](#_bookmark189)on page [137](#_bookmark189))    ## wlHttp (object)  **Description**  The wlHttp object stores configuration information for immediate user activities, including properties defining expected dialog boxes, verification test selections, and dynamic state management. Many of these properties are duplicated in the wlGlobals (see [*w*](#_bookmark460)[*lGlobals (object)* ](#_bookmark460)on page [313](#_bookmark460)), which contains the default global configuration settings for browser actions, and in the wlLocals (see [*wlLocals (object)*](#_bookmark470)on page [319](#_bookmark469)), which contains the local configuration settings for browser actions. To understand how there could potentially be three different settings for a single configuration property, see the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide*. The wlHttp object also contains the methods that implement the user activities saved during the WebLOAD Recorder recording session. User activities may be recreated through one of two approaches: the high-level User Action mode or the low-level HTTP Protocol mode. Methods for each of these testing modes are included in the wlHttp object.  **Properties and Methods**  The wlHttp object includes the following property and method classes:  * *Automatic State Management for HTTP Protocol Mode* (on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * [*Transaction Verification Components* ](#_bookmark39)(on page [36](#_bookmark38))  **Syntax**  Each individual function class includes the syntax specifications that apply to that class.  **GUI mode**  The wlHttp property and method descriptions explain how to explicitly set values for these session configuration properties within your JavaScript script files.   **Note:** The recommended way to set configuration values is through the WebLOAD Recorder, using the Default, Current, and Global Options dialog boxes accessed from the **Tools** tab in the Console desktop ribbon. The dialog boxes provide a means of defining and setting configuration values with ease, simplicity, and clarity.  **See also**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlLocals](#wllocals-object)    ## wlInputFile (object)  **Description**  The wlInputFile object supports reading values from an external text file. This is useful when you need to parameterize your script. The input file supports the following access methods:  * Unique access to a parameters file\u2019s record. This ensures that a value that was read by VC1 will not be read by any other VC as long as VC1 is using this value. * Shared access for a parameters file among Load Generators and Load Machines and among different scripts. * Sequential and random access to a parameters file.  The wlInputFile object enables Load Generators running on more than one load machine to access a single parameters file in a way that enables unique reading of the parameters from the file. In addition, a single parameters file can be accessed by more  than one script in a way that enables unique reading of parameters from the file by all of the scripts.  Create wlInputFile objects and manage your files using the constructor and methods described in this section.  **Syntax**  MyFileObj = new wlInputFile(fileID)  **Parameters**  | **Parameter Name** | **Description**                                                                          | | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | fileID                   | An identifier which refers  to the local file. This value is returned by the CopyFile command. |  **Example**   <pre><code>fileID = CopyFile(`&lt;full path&gt;`)\n\n\u2026\n\nMyFileObj = new wlInputFile(*fileID*)\n\n\u2026\n\nMyFileObj.Open([AccessMethod], [ShareMethod], [UsageMethod], [EndOfFileBehavior], [HeaderLines])\n</code></pre>   **Methods**  * Open() (see [*Open() (method)* ](#_bookmark260)on page [180](#_bookmark260)) * GetLine() (see [*G*](#_bookmark166)[*etLine() (function)* ](#_bookmark166)on page [123](#_bookmark166))  **See also**  * [*Using the IntelliSense JavaScript Editor* ](#_bookmark18)(on page [18](#_bookmark18)) * CopyFile() (see [*CopyFile() (function)* ](#_bookmark76)on page [61](#_bookmark76))    ## wlInputFile() (constructor)  **Method of Object**  * wlInputFile (see [*wlInputFile (object)* ](#_bookmark467)on page [317](#_bookmark467))  **Description**  Creates a new wlInputFile object. For optimal performance, construct a new file object in the InitClient section of your script. The file is copied from the Console to the Load Generator. The input file specified in the wlInputFile object is opened.  **Syntax**  myFileObj = new wlInputFile(fileID)  **Parameters**  | **Parameter Name** | **Description**                                                                          | | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | fileID                   | An identifier which refers  to the local file. This value is returned by the CopyFile command. |  **Return Value**  A pointer to a new wlInputFile object.  **Example**   <pre><code>fileID = CopyFile(`&lt;full path&gt;`)\n\n\u2026\n\nMyFileObj = new wlInputFile(*fileID*)\n\n\u2026\n\nMyFileObj.Open([AccessMethod], [ShareMethod], [UsageMethod], [EndOfFileBehavior], [HeaderLines])\n</code></pre>     ## wlLocals (object)  **Description**  The wlLocals object stores the local default configuration information for user activities, such as the URL, user name and password, proxy server, and dialog box management. wlLocals is a local object. WebLOAD creates an independent wlLocals object for *each thread* of a script. You cannot declare wlLocals objects yourself.  The properties of the wlLocals object are all duplicated in the [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object), which contains the default global settings, and in the  [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object), which contains the settings for an immediate action. To understand how there could potentially be three different settings for a single configuration property, see the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide*.  **Properties**  The wlLocals object includes the following property classes:  * *Automatic State Management for HTTP Protocol Mode* (on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * [*H*](#_bookmark21)[*TTP Components* ](#_bookmark21)(on page [24](#_bookmark21)) * [*Transaction Verification Components* ](#_bookmark39)(on page [36](#_bookmark38))  **Syntax**  Each individual function class includes the syntax specifications that apply to that class.  **GUI mode**  The wlLocals property and method descriptions explain how to explicitly set values for these session configuration properties within your JavaScript script files.   **Note:** The recommended way to set configuration values is through the WebLOAD Recorder, using the Default, Current, and Global Options dialog boxes accessed from the **Tools** tab in the Console desktop ribbon. The dialog boxes provide a means of defining and setting configuration values with ease, simplicity, and clarity.  **See also**  * [wlGlobals](#wlglobals-object) * [wlHttp](#wlhttp-object)    ## wlMetas (object)  **Property of Objects**  META objects on a Web page are accessed through wlMetas objects that are grouped into collections of wlMetas. The wlMetas collection is a property of the following objects:  * document (see [*document (object)* ](#_bookmark100)on page [78](#_bookmark100))  **Description**  Each wlMetas object stores the parsed data for an HTML meta object (`` tag). wlMetas objects are local to a single thread. You cannot create new wlMetas objects using the JavaScript new operator, but you can access them through the properties and methods of the standard DOM objects. wlMetas properties are read only.  **Syntax**  wlMetas objects are grouped together within collections of wlMetas. To access an individual wlMetas\u2019s properties, check the length property of the wlMetas collection and use an index number to access the individual wlMetas object, with the following syntax:  NumberofMetaObjects = document.wlMetas.length document.wlMetas[#].&lt;*wlMetas-property*&gt;  **Example**  To find out how many wlMetas objects are contained within a document header, check the value of:  document.wlMetas.length  Access each wlMetas\u2019s properties directly using the preceding syntax. For example:  document.wlMetas[0].key  **Properties**  The wlMetas object includes the following properties:  * content (see [*content (property)* ](#_bookmark68)on page [56](#_bookmark68)) * httpEquiv (see [*httpEquiv (property)* ](#_bookmark204)on page [144](#_bookmark204)) * Name (see [*Name (property)* ](#_bookmark251)on page [172](#_bookmark251)) * Url (see [*Url (property)* ](#_bookmark422)on page [289](#_bookmark422))  **See also**  * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23))    ## wlNumberParam() (parameterization)  **Description**  Define a number parameter.  **Syntax**  paramName = wlNumberParam (ParamID, MinValue, MaxValue,Step, AccessMethod, Scope, UsageMethod, OutOfValuesBehavior);  **Parameters**  | **Parameter Name** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | ParamID                  | A string that is a unique parameter identifier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | | MinValue                 | The minimum value of the number range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | | MaxValue                 | The maximum value of the number range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | | Step                     | The increment between numbers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | | AccessMethod             | Defines the method for  calculating the next value from the range. All values are enumerated numeric  values. Possible values are:``wlParamRandom. Gets a random value from  the range.  ``wlParamOrdered. Every client gets the  next value from the range (order  is important).  ``wlParamNotOrdered. Every client gets the  next value from the range (order is not important). | | Scope | Defines the scope (  sharing policy) of the parameter. Possible values are:``wlParamGlobal. All virtual clients read  values from the shared (global )  pool.  ``wlParamLocal. Each virtual client  reads values from its own pool.  ``wlParamGlobalLocked. All virtual clients read unique values from the shared (global  ) pool. | | Usage Method | Defines when the parameter  is updated, meaning when a new value will be read. Possible values are:``WLParamUpdateRound. The script reads a new  value from the file once for each round. Using the same parameter again in the same round will result in  the same value.  ``WLParamUpdateOnce. The script reads a new  value from the file once at the  beginning of the test (in InitClient). All usage of the  parameter by that Virtual Client will always result in the same value.  ``WLParamUpdateUse. The parameter\u2019s value  will be read each time it is used. | | OutOfValuesBehavior | Defines how WebLOAD  behaves when it reaches the end of the range. All values are enumerated  numeric values. Possible values are:``WLParamKeepLast. Keep the last value.  ``WLParamCycle. Start from the beginning  of the range.  ``WLParamStopVC. Abort the specific  Virtual Client that tried to read past the end of the range. An error message  is written  to the log  file. |  **Example**   <pre><code>function InitClient()\n\n{\n\nNewParam1 = wlNumberParam(\"NewParam1\",1, 100, 1, wlParamRandom, wlParamLocal, wlParamUpdateRound, wlParamCycle);\n\n}\n\n/***** WLIDE - Message - ID:3 *****/ InfoMessage(NewParam1.getValue())\n\n// END WLIDE\n</code></pre>     ## wlOutputFile (object)  **Description**  The wlOutputFile object writes script output messages to a global output file. Create wlOutputFile objects and manage your files using the constructor and methods described in this section.  **Syntax**   <pre><code>MyFileObj = new wlOutputFile(\u201c*filename\u201d*)\n\n\u2026\n\nMyFileObj.Write(\u201cHappy Birthday\u201d)\n\n\u2026\n\ndelete MyFileObj\n</code></pre>   **Example**  Each individual property includes examples of the syntax for that property.  **Methods**  * Close() (see [*Close() (function)* ](#_bookmark61)on page [52](#_bookmark61)) * remove() (see [*remove() (method)* ](#_bookmark93)on page [74](#_bookmark93)) * Open() (see [*Open() (function)* ](#_bookmark261)on page [183](#_bookmark261)) * Reset() (see [*Reset() (method)* ](#_bookmark310)on page [220](#_bookmark310)) * wlOutputFile() (see [*wlOutputFile() (constructor)* ](#_bookmark476)on page [324](#_bookmark476)) * Write() (see [*Write() (method)* ](#_bookmark504)on page [343](#_bookmark504)) * Writeln() (see [*Writeln() (method)* ](#_bookmark506)on page [344](#_bookmark506))  **Comment**  You may also use the WebLOAD functions listed here to open and close output files.  * To **open** an output file:  Open(filename)  * To **close** an output file:  Close(filename)  When you use the Close() function to close a file data will be flashed to the disk.  &gt;  **Note:** Declaring a new wlOutputFile object creates a new, empty output file. If a file of that name already exists, the file will be completely overwritten. Information will not be appended to the end of an existing file. Be sure to choose a *unique filename* for the new output file if you do not want to overwrite previous script data.    If you declare a new wlOutputFile object in the InitAgenda() function of a script, the output file will be shared by all the script threads. There is no way to specify a specific thread writing sequence-each thread will write to the output file in real time as it reaches that line in the script execution.  If you declare a new wlOutputFile object in the InitClient() function or main body of a script, use the thread number variable as part of the new filename to be sure that each thread will create a unique output file.  If you declare a new wlOutputFile object in the main body of a script, and then run your script for multiple iterations, use the RoundNum variable as part of the new filename to be sure that each new round will create a unique output file.  Generally, you should only create new wlOutputFile objects in the InitAgenda() or InitClient() functions of a script, not in the main script. If a statement in the main script creates an object, *a new object is created each time the statement is executed*. If WebLOAD repeats the main script many times, a large number of objects may be created and the system may run out of memory.  **See also**  * CopyFile() (see [*CopyFile() (function)* ](#_bookmark76)on page [61](#_bookmark76)) * [*File Management Functions* ](#_bookmark25)(on page [*28*](#_bookmark25)) * GetLine() (see [*GetLine() (function)* ](#_bookmark166)on page [123](#_bookmark166)) * IncludeFile() (see [*IncludeFile() (function)* ](#_bookmark212)on page [150](#_bookmark212)) * [*Using the IntelliSense JavaScript Editor* ](#_bookmark18)(on page [18](#_bookmark18))    ## wlOutputFile() (constructor)  **Method of Object**  * wlOutputFile (see [*wlOutputFile (object)* ](#_bookmark475)on page [323](#_bookmark475))  **Description**  To create a new wlOutputFile object, use the wlOutputFile() constructor.  **Syntax**  new wlOutputFile(filename)  **Parameters**  | **Parameter Name** | **Description**                      | | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | | filename                 | Name of the new output file to be created. |  **Return Value**  A pointer to a new wlOutputFile object.  **Example**  `MyFileObj = new wlOutputFile(\u201cFileName\u201d)`    Declaring a new wlOutputFile object creates a new, empty output file. If a file of that name already exists, the file will be completely overwritten. Information will not be appended to the end of an existing file. Be sure to choose a *unique filename* for the new output file if you do not want to overwrite previous script data.  If you declare a new wlOutputFile object in the InitAgenda() function of a script, the output file will be shared by all the script threads. There is no way to specify a specific thread writing sequence-each thread will write to the output file in real time as it reaches that line in the script execution.  If you declare a new wlOutputFile object in the InitClient() function or main body of a script, use the thread number variable as part of the new filename to be sure that each thread will create a unique output file.  If you declare a new wlOutputFile object in the main body of a script, and then run your script for multiple iterations, use the RoundNum variable as part of the new filename to be sure that each new round will create a unique output file.  *Ideally*, create new wlOutputFile objects only in the InitAgenda() function of a script, not in the main script. If a statement in the main script creates an object, a new object is created *each time the statement is executed*. If WebLOAD repeats the main script many times, a large number of objects may be created and the system may run out of memory.  **See also**  * Close() (see [*Close() (function)* ](#_bookmark61)on page [52](#_bookmark61)) * CopyFile() (see [*CopyFile() (function)* ](#_bookmark76)on page [61](#_bookmark76)) * Delete() (see [*D*](#_bookmark93)[*elete() (cookie method)* ](#_bookmark93)on page [75](#_bookmark95)) * [*File Management Functions* ](#_bookmark25)(on page [*28*](#_bookmark25)) * GetLine() (see [*GetLine() (function)* ](#_bookmark166)on page [123](#_bookmark166)) * IncludeFile() (see [*IncludeFile() (function)* ](#_bookmark212)on page [150](#_bookmark212)) * Open() (see [*Open() (function)* ](#_bookmark261)on page [183](#_bookmark261)) * Reset() (see [*Reset() (method)* ](#_bookmark310)on page [220](#_bookmark310)) * [*Using the IntelliSense JavaScript Editor* ](#_bookmark18)(on page [18](#_bookmark18)) * wlOutputFile (see [*wlOutputFile (object)* ](#_bookmark475)on page [323](#_bookmark475)) * Write() (see [*Write() (method)* ](#_bookmark504)on page [343](#_bookmark504)) * Writeln() (see [*Writeln() (method)* ](#_bookmark506)on page [344](#_bookmark506))    ## wlRand (object)  **Description**  The wlRand object is a random number generator.  wlRand is a local object. WebLOAD automatically creates an independent wlRand  object for the test session script. You cannot declare wlRand objects yourself.  **Syntax** wlRand.*Method*() **Example**  The following example generates three random numbers having the following possible  values:  * Any integer. * An integer from 1 to 9. * One of the three numbers 0, 1, or 1.5.   <pre><code>function InitAgenda() \n\n{ \n\nwlRand.Seed(23)\n\n}\n</code></pre>   `AnyInteger = wlRand.Num() OneToNine = wlRand.Range(1, 9)`  OneOfThreeNumbers = wlRand.Select(0, 1, 1.5)  **Methods**  * Num() (see [*Num() (method)* ](#_bookmark256)on page [177](#_bookmark256))  * Range() (see [*Range() (method)* ](#_bookmark300)on page [215](#_bookmark300))  * Seed() (see [*Seed() (method)* ](#_bookmark326)on page [229](#_bookmark326))  * Select() (see [*Select() (method)* ](#_bookmark329)on page [230](#_bookmark329))    ## wlSearchPairs (object)  **Method of Object**  * link (see [*link (object)* ](#_bookmark235)on page [162](#_bookmark235)) * location (see [*location (object)* ](#_bookmark243)on page [168](#_bookmark243))  **Description**  Each wlSearchPairs object contains a parsed version of the search attribute string, storing the key/value pairs found in a document\u2019s *URL search strings*. (For key-value pairs found in HTTP *response headers*, see wlHeaders (see [*wlHeaders (object)* ](#_bookmark462)on page [314](#_bookmark461)). Information found in *request headers* is available through the wlHttp.Header (see [*Header (property)* ](#_bookmark195)on page [140](#_bookmark195)) property.)  wlSearchPairs objects are grouped into wlSearchPairs collections, where the collections are themselves properties of the link and location objects.  wlSearchPairs objects are local to a single thread. You cannot create new wlSearchPairs objects using the JavaScript new operator, but you can access them through the properties and methods of the standard DOM objects. wlSearchPairs properties are read only.  **Syntax**  wlSearchPairs objects are grouped together within collections of wlSearchPairs. To access an individual wlSearchPairs\u2019s properties, check the length property of the wlSearchPairs collection and use an index number to access the individual wlSearchPairs object, with the following syntax:  `NumberofSearchPairObjects = document.links[1].wlSearchPairs.length`   `document.links[1].wlSearchPairs[*index*#].&lt;*wlSearchPairs-property*&gt;`  **Example**  To find out how many wlSearchPairs objects are contained within a document\u2019s link, check the value of:  document.links[1].wlSearchPairs.length  Access each wlSearchPairs\u2019s properties directly through the index number of that item. For example:  document.links[1].wlSearchPairs[0].key  Suppose that the third link on a Web page has the following HTML code:   ISDN Modems ``  You can download the page and parse the links using the following script:   <pre><code>function InitAgenda() {\n\nwlGlobals.Url = [\u201chttp://www.ABCDEF.com](http://www.ABCDEF.com/)\u201d\n\n//Enable link parsing wlGlobals.ParseLinks = true\n\n}\n\nwlHttp.Get()\n</code></pre>   For the link in question, WebLOAD stores the attribute pairs in the document.links[2].wlSearchPairs property. This property is actually a collection containing two wlSearchPairs objects. The following is a complete listing of the collection.  document.links[2].wlSearchPairs[0].key = \u201cProduct\u201d document.links[2].wlSearchPairs[0].value = \u201cmodems\u201d document.links[2].wlSearchPairs[1].key = \u201cType\u201d document.links[2].wlSearchPairs[1].value = \u201cISDN\u201d  **Properties**  The wlSearchPairs object includes the following properties:  * key (see [*key (property)* ](#_bookmark229)on page [160](#_bookmark229)) * value (see [*value (property)* ](#_bookmark430)on page [294](#_bookmark430))  **See also**  * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)) * Header (see [*Header (property)* ](#_bookmark195)on page [140](#_bookmark195)) * link (see [*link (object)* ](#_bookmark235)on page [162](#_bookmark235)) * location (see [*location (object)* ](#_bookmark243)on page [168](#_bookmark243)) * wlHeaders (see [*w*](#_bookmark461)[*lHeaders (object)* ](#_bookmark461)on page [314](#_bookmark461)) * wlHttp (see [*wlHttp (object)* ](#_bookmark465)on page [316](#_bookmark465))    ## wlSet() (method)  **Method of Objects**  The wlHttp object includes the following collections for storing data. These data storage collections each include the method wlSet().  * wlHttp.Data (see [*Data (property)* ](#_bookmark80)on page [66](#_bookmark80)) * wlHttp.DataFile (see [*DataFile (property)* ](#_bookmark82)on page [67](#_bookmark82)) * wlHttp.FormData (see [*FormData (property)* ](#_bookmark127)on page [97](#_bookmark127)) * wlHttp.Header (see [*Header (property)* ](#_bookmark195)on page [140](#_bookmark195))  **Description**  wlSet() is used when assigning a value to an element in the collection, to distinguish between keywords and user-defined variables that share the same names. The need for this care is explained in this section.  **Syntax**  wlHttp.*Collection*.wlSet(FieldName, Value)  **Parameters**  | **Parameter Name** | **Description**                                          | | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | | FieldName                | A string with the name of the field whose value is  to be set. | | Value                    | The value to be assigned to the specified  field.              |  **Return Value**  The value of the specified property.  **Example** wlHttp.FormData.wlSet(\u201cFirstName\u201d, \u201cBill\u201d) **Comment**  In JavaScript, users may work interchangeably with either an array[index] or  array.index notation. For example, the following two references are interchangeable:  wlHttp.FormData[\u201cSunday\u201d]  -Or-  wlHttp.FormData.Sunday  This flexibility is convenient for programmers, who are able to select the syntax that is most appropriate for the context. However, it could potentially lead to ambiguity. For example, assume a website included a form with a field called length. This could lead to a confusing situation, where the word length appearing in a script could represent either the number of elements in a FormData array, as explained in length, or the value of the length field in the form. Errors would arise from a reasonable assignment statement such as:  wlHttp.FormData[\u201clength\u201d] = 7  This is equivalent to the illegal assignment statement:  wlHttp.FormData.length = 7  WebLOAD therefore uses wlSet() to set field data whenever the name could lead to potential ambiguity. When recording scripts with the AAT, WebLOAD recognizes  potential ambiguities and inserts the appropriate wlSet() statements automatically. In this case:  wlHttp.FormData.wlSet(\u201clength\u201d, 7)  **See also**  * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)) * Data (see [*Data (property)* ](#_bookmark80)on page [66](#_bookmark80)) * DataFile (see [*DataFile (property)* ](#_bookmark82)on page [67](#_bookmark82)) * FormData (see [*FormData (property)* ](#_bookmark127)on page [97](#_bookmark127)) * Header (see [*Header (property)* ](#_bookmark195)on page [140](#_bookmark195)) * wlHttp (see [*wlHttp (object)* ](#_bookmark465)on page [316](#_bookmark465))    ## wlSource (property)  **Property of Object**  * document (see [*document (object)* ](#_bookmark100)on page [78](#_bookmark100))  **Description**  The complete HTML source code of the frame (read-only string).  You can use the HTML source to search for any desired information in an HTML page. For information on JavaScript searching capabilities, see *Regular Expressions* in the *Netscape JavaScript Guide*, which is supplied with the WebLOAD software.  **Syntax** document.wlSource **Comment**  To use the HTML source, you must enable the SaveSource (see [*SaveSource (property)* ](#_bookmark320)on page [226](#_bookmark320)) property of the wlGlobals, wlLocals, or wlHttp object. To save the source in a file, use the Outfile property (see [*Outfile (property)* ](#_bookmark268)on page [188](#_bookmark268)).  **See also**  * Outfile (see [*Outfile (property)* ](#_bookmark268)on page [188](#_bookmark268)) * SaveSource (see [*SaveSource (property)* ](#_bookmark320)on page [226](#_bookmark320))  ## wlStatusLine (property)  **Property of Object**  * document (see [*document (object)* ](#_bookmark100)on page [78](#_bookmark100))  **Description**  The status line of the HTTP header (read-only string, for example \u201cOK\u201d).  **Syntax**  `document.wlHeaders[\u201cstatus line\u201d]`    ## wlStatusNumber (property)  **Property of Object**  * document (see [*document (object)* ](#_bookmark100)on page [78](#_bookmark100))  **Description**  The HTTP status value, which WebLOAD retrieves from the HTTP header (read-only integer, for example 200).  **Syntax**  `document.wlStatusNumber`    ## wlStringParam() (parameterization)  **Description**  Define a random string parameter.  **Syntax**  `` = wlStringParam(minLength, maxLength, usage)  **Parameters**  | **Parameter Name** | **Description**                              | | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | | minLength                | The minimum string length (number of characters),  | | maxLength                | The maximum string length (number of  characters). | | usage | Defines when the parameter  is updated, meaning when a new value will be calculated. Possible values are:``wlParamUpdateRound. The parameters value  will be calculated once for each round. Using the same parameter again in the same round will result with the same value.  ``wlParamUpdateOnce. The parameter\u2019s value  will be calculated once per each Virtual Client (in its InitClient function). All usage of  the parameter by that Virtual Client will always result in the same value.  ``wlParamUpdateUse. The parameter\u2019s value  will be calculated each time it is used. |  **Example**  `function InitClient()`  `{`  `NewParam1 = wlStringParam(2, 7, wlParamUpdateUse);`  `}`  `/***** WLIDE - Message - ID:3 *****/ InfoMessage(NewParam1.getValue())`  `// END WLIDE`    ## wlSystemGlobal (object)  **Description**  WebLOAD provides a global object called wlSystemGlobal. The wlSystemGlobal object enables sharing of global variables and values between all elements of a test session, across multiple scripts running on multiple Load Generators. (Compare to the wlGeneratorGlobal (see [*w*](#_bookmark450)[*lGeneratorGlobal (object)* ](#_bookmark450)on page [309](#_bookmark450)), which enables sharing of global variables and values between all threads of a single Load Generator, and to the wlGlobals (see [*w*](#_bookmark460)[*lGlobals (object)* ](#_bookmark460)on page [313](#_bookmark460)), which enables sharing of global variables and values between all threads of a single script, running on a single Load Generator.)  Globally shared variables are useful when tracking a value or maintaining a count across multiple threads or platforms. For example, you may include these shared values in the messages sent to the Log window during a test session.  WebLOAD creates exactly one wlSystemGlobal object per a test session. Use the wlSystemGlobal object methods to create and access variable values that you wish to share system-wide. Edit wlSystemGlobal object properties and methods through the IntelliSense editor, described in [*Using the IntelliSense JavaScript Editor* ](#_bookmark18)(on page [18](#_bookmark18)).  While global variables may be accessed anywhere in your script, be sure to initially declare wlSystemGlobal values in the InitAgenda() *function only*. Do not define  new values within the main body of a script, for they will not be shared correctly by all threads.  **Methods**  * Add() (see [*Add() (method)* ](#_bookmark45)on page [39](#_bookmark43)) * Get() (see [*Get() (addition method)* ](#_bookmark134)on page [102](#_bookmark134)) * Set() (see [*Set() (addition method)* ](#_bookmark350)on page [240](#_bookmark350))  **Properties**  wlSystemGlobal incorporates a dynamic property set that consists of whatever global variables have been defined, set, and accessed by the user through the wlSystemGlobal method set only.  **See also**  * wlGeneratorGlobal (see [*w*](#_bookmark450)[*lGeneratorGlobal (object)* ](#_bookmark450)on page [309](#_bookmark450))    ## wlTables (object)  **Property of Object**  TABLE objects on a Web page are accessed through wlTables objects that are grouped into collections of wlTables. The wlTables collection is a property of the following object:  * document (see [*document (object)* ](#_bookmark100)on page [78](#_bookmark100))  **Description**  Each wlTables object contains the parsed data for an HTML table (`` tag), and serves as a means of providing access to the cells of the HTML table. Because table data is organized into rows and cells, the wlTables object is also linked to row and cell objects and their properties.  wlTables objects are grouped together within collections of wlTables. The tables are arranged in the order in which they appear on the HTML page.  **Syntax**  To access an individual wlTables\u2019s properties, check the length property of the wlTables collection and use an index number to access the individual wlTables object, with the following syntax:  NumberofTableObjects = document.wlTables.length document.wlTables[*index*#].&lt;*wlTables-property*&gt;  **Example**  Access each wlTables\u2019s properties directly through the index number of that item. For example:  document.wlTables[0].cols  wlTables objects may also be accessed directly using the table ID. This is illustrated in the *id* property description.  **Properties**  Each wlTables object contains information about the data found in the whole table, organized by rows, columns, and cells. The wlTables object includes the following properties:  * cell * cols (see [*cols (property)* ](#_bookmark64)on page [54](#_bookmark64)) (wlTables property) * id (see [*id (property)* ](#_bookmark208)on page [146](#_bookmark208)) (wlTables property) * row (see [*row (object)* ](#_bookmark315)on page [223](#_bookmark315)) (wlTables property)  **See also**  * cellIndex * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)) * Compare() (see [*Compare() (method)* ](#_bookmark65)on page [55](#_bookmark65)) * CompareColumns (see [*CompareColumns (property)* ](#_bookmark65)on page [55](#_bookmark65)) * CompareRows (see [*CompareRows (property)* ](#_bookmark65)on page [55](#_bookmark65)) * Details (see [*Details (property)* ](#_bookmark96)on page [76](#_bookmark96)) * InnerHTML (see [*InnerHTML (property)* ](#_bookmark219)on page [154](#_bookmark219)) (cell property) * InnerText (see [*InnerText (property)* ](#_bookmark223)on page [156](#_bookmark223)) (cell property) * MatchBy (see [*MatchBy (property)* ](#_bookmark246)on page [170](#_bookmark246)) * Prepare() (see [*Prepare() (method)* ](#_bookmark291)on page [208](#_bookmark291)) * ReportUnexpectedRows (see [*ReportUnexpectedRows (property)* ](#_bookmark310)on page [220](#_bookmark310)) * rowIndex (see [*rowIndex (property)* ](#_bookmark317)on page [224](#_bookmark317)) (row property) * tagName (see [*tagName (property)* ](#_bookmark407)on page [279](#_bookmark407)) (cell property)    ## wlTarget (property)  **Property of Object**  * wlHttp (see [*wlHttp (object)* ](#_bookmark465)on page [316](#_bookmark465))  **Description**  The exact location within the Web page of the frame into which the transaction should be downloaded.  **Syntax**  `wlHttp.wlTarget = \u201cLocationString\u201d`  **Comment**  wlTarget uses the WebLOAD shorthand notation, described in the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide*. For example, assume the expected location is set to #1.#1. Since frame numbering begins with 0, this refers to the second subframe located within the second frame on the Web page. Neither frame has been assigned an optional name value.  The wlHttp.wlTarget property of a transaction stores the complete path of the frame, from the root window of the Web page. Compare this to the form.target and link.target properties, which identify the most recent, immediate location of the target frame using the name string or keyword that was assigned to that frame. The last field of the wlHttp.wlTarget string is the target name stored in the form.target and link.target properties.    ## wlTimeParam() (parameterization)  **Description**  Return the current date and/or time according to the format specified in the parameter\u2019s properties  **Syntax**  ` = wlTimeParam(format, offset, usage)`  **Parameters**  | **Parameter Name** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | format                   | Formats are comprised from symbols, prefixed with  the \u2018%\u2019 sign and from textual characters.

The property descriptions here are intended mainly to explain the lines of code seen in the JavaScript View of the WebLOAD Recorder desktop. Syntax details are also provided for the benefit of users who prefer to manually edit the JavaScript code of their scripts through the IntelliSense editor, described in [*Using the IntelliSense JavaScript Editor* ](#_bookmark18)(on page [18](#_bookmark18)).  **Properties**  The wlVerification object includes the following property classes:  * *Page Time* * *Page Content Length* * *Severity* * *Function* * *Error Message*  **Methods**  * [*Title (function)*](#_bookmark417) * [*ContentLength (function)*](#_bookmark70) * [*MaxPageTime (function)*](#_bookmark247) * [*Text (function)*](#_bookmark411)  **Syntax**  Each individual property class includes the syntax specifications that apply to that class.  **GUI mode**  The wlVerification property and method descriptions explain how to explicitly set values for these response validations within your JavaScript script files.  The recommended way to set response validation values is through the WebLOAD Recorder, using the Response Validation dialog box accessed from the **Home** tab in the WebLOAD Recorder desktop ribbon. The dialog box provide a means of defining and setting response validation values with ease, simplicity, and clarity.  **See also**  * PageContentLength (see [*PageContentLength (property)* ](#_bookmark270)on page [189](#_bookmark270)) * PageTime (see [*PageTime (property)* ](#_bookmark271)on page [190](#_bookmark271)) * Severity (see [*Severity (property)* ](#_bookmark360)on page [247](#_bookmark360)) * Function (see [*Function (property)* ](#_bookmark130)on page [100](#_bookmark130)) * ErrorMessage (see [*ErrorMessage (property)* ](#_bookmark116)on page [91](#_bookmark116)) * Title (see [*Title (function)* ](#_bookmark417)on page [285](#_bookmark417))  ## wlVersion (property)  **Property of Objects**  * document (see [*document (object)* ](#_bookmark100)on page [78](#_bookmark100))  **Description**  The HTTP protocol version, which WebLOAD retrieves from the HTTP header (read- only string, for example \u201c1.1\u201d).  **Example**  `currentVersionNumber = document.wlVersion`    ## WLXmlDocument() (constructor)  **Method of Object**  * wlXmls (see [*wlXmls (object)* ](#_bookmark502)on page [340](#_bookmark502))  **Description**  Call WLXmlDocument() without any parameters to create a new, blank XML DOM object. The new object may be filled later with any new data you prefer. If the DTD section of your XML document includes any external references, use this form of the WLXmlDocument() constructor to create new XML DOM objects. You may add nodes and post the new XML data to a website as described in the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide*.  Call WLXmlDocument() with a string parameter to create new XML DOM objects from an XML string that includes a completely self-contained DTD section with no external references.  **Syntax**  `new WLXmlDocument([xmlString])`  **Parameters**  | **Parameter Name** | **Description**                                                         | | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | [xmlString]              | Optional string parameter that contains a complete  set of XML document data. |  **Return Value**  Returns a new XML DOM object. If the constructor was called with no parameters, the new object will be empty. If the constructor was called with an XML string, the new object will contain an XML DOM hierarchy based on the XML data found in the parameter string.  **Example**  NewBlankXMLObj = new WLXmlDocument()  -Or-  `NewXMLObj = new WLXmlDocument(xmlStr)`  **Comment**  Objects created by the WLXmlDocument() constructor provide access to the XML DOM Document Interface. They do not expose the HTML property set, (id, innerHTML, and src), as those properties have no meaning for XML DOM objects created this way.  **See also**  * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)) * id (see [*id (property)* ](#_bookmark208)on page [146](#_bookmark208)) * InnerHTML (see [*InnerHTML (property)* ](#_bookmark219)on page [154](#_bookmark219)) * load() (see [*load() (method)* ](#_bookmark236)on page [163](#_bookmark236)) * [*load() and loadXML() Method Comparison* ](#_bookmark238)(on page [164](#_bookmark238)) * loadXML() (see [*loadXML() (method)* ](#_bookmark242)on page [167](#_bookmark242)) * src (see [*src (property)* ](#_bookmark371)on page [252](#_bookmark371)) * XMLDocument (see [*XMLDocument (property)* ](#_bookmark509)on page [345](#_bookmark509))    ## wlXmls (object)  **Property of Object**  * document (see [*document (object)* ](#_bookmark100)on page [78](#_bookmark100))  **Description**  WebLOAD has extended the standard IE Browser DOM document object with the wlXmls collection of XML DOM objects, providing full access to XML structures. Using XML DOM objects, WebLOAD scripts are able to both *access* XML site information, and *generate new XML data* to send back to the server for processing, taking advantage of all the additional benefits that XML provides.  Both WebLOAD and the IE Browser use the MSXML parser to create XML DOM objects. Since WebLOAD XML DOM objects and Browser XML DOM objects are created by the same MSXML parser, the XML DOM objects that are produced for both WebLOAD and the IE Browser are identical.  When working through the IE Browser, XML DOM objects are found in the all collection. When working through WebLOAD, XML DOM objects are found in the wlXmls collection. Since a WebLOAD XML DOM object is identical to an IE Browser XML DOM object, the WebLOAD XML DOM uses the same Document Interface (programming methods and properties) found in the IE Browser XML DOM.  This section describes the wlXmls collection and the properties and methods used most often when working with WebLOAD XML DOM objects. For an explanation of the XML DOM, see the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide*. For a complete list of the XML DOM properties and methods supported by WebLOAD, see *WebLOAD-supported XML DOM Interfaces* (on page [457](#_bookmark583)).   **Note:** WebLOAD supports a new method for parsing and manipulating XML data. For more information see [*XML Parser* Object ](#_bookmark563)on page [437.](#_bookmark563)  **Syntax**  XML DOM objects are grouped together within wlXmls collections. The XML DOM objects are arranged in the order in which they appear on the HTML page.  To access an individual XML DOM object\u2019s data and Document Interface, check the length property of the wlXmls collection and use an index number to access the individual XML DOM object.  Access the *HTML properties* for each XML DOM object directly using the following syntax:  document.wlXmls[#].&lt;*html-DOM property*&gt;  Access the *XML DOM Document Interface* for each document element directly using the following syntax:  document.wlXmls[#].XMLDocument.documentElement.&lt;*property*&gt;  **Example**  To find out how many XML DOM objects are contained within a document, check the value of:  `document.wlXmls.length`  Access the HTML property src as follows:  `document.wlXmls[0].src`  Access the XML DOM document interface as follows:  document.wlXmls[0].XMLDocument.documentElement.nodeName  XML DOM objects may also be accessed directly using the XML ID. For example, if the first XML object on a page is assigned the ID tag myXmlDoc, you could access the object using any of the following:  `MyBookstore = document.wlXmls[0]`  -Or-  `MyBookstore = document.wlXmls.myXmlDoc`  -Or-  `MyBookstore = document.wlXmls[\u201cmyXmlDoc\u201d]`  The following example illustrates HTML property usage. Assume you are working with a Web Bookstore site that includes the following inventory database code fragment:   <pre><code>&lt;xml ID=\"xmlBookSite\"&gt;\n\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\u201d?&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Bookstore inventory database --&gt;\n\n&lt;bookstore&gt;\n\nJavaScript Reference Guide\n\n`&lt;author&gt;`Mark Twain `&lt;/author&gt;`\n\n&lt;title&gt;Tom Sawyer&lt;/title&gt;\n\n`&lt;price&gt;`$11.00 `&lt;/price&gt;`\n\n&lt;/book&gt;\n\nJavaScript Reference Guide\n\n`&lt;author&gt;`Oscar Wilde `&lt;/author&gt;`\n\n&lt;title&gt;The Giant And His Garden&lt;/title&gt;\n\n`&lt;price&gt;`$8.00 `&lt;/price&gt;`\n\n&lt;/book&gt;\n\n&lt;/bookstore&gt;\n\n&lt;/xml&gt;\n</code></pre>   When accessing this website, your script may use the standard HTML properties id and innerHTML to print out text strings showing the information found within the XML tags, as follows:   <pre><code>var XMLBookstoreDoc = document.wlXmls[0] \n\nInfoMessage(\u201cID = \u201c + XMLBookstoreDoc.id) \n\nInfoMessage(\u201cHTML text = \u201c + XMLBookstoreDoc.innerHTML)\n</code></pre>   Running this script produces the following output:  `ID = xmlBookSite`  `HTML text = `  \u2026etc.  **Methods and Properties**  WebLOAD supports all standard W3C XML DOM properties and methods, listed in *WebLOAD-supported XML DOM Interfaces* (on page [457](#_bookmark583)).

You may access the XML DOM properties and methods without including XMLDocument in the object reference. For  example:  document.wlXmls[0].documentElement.*``*  However, including XMLDocument is a good programming practice, to emphasize the fact that you are dealing directly with an XML DOM object and not a Data Island.  **Example** document.wlXmls[0].XMLDocument.documentElement.nodeName **See also**  * [*Collections* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [27](#_bookmark23)) * id (see [*id (property)* ](#_bookmark208)on page [146](#_bookmark208)) * InnerHTML (see [*InnerHTML (property)* ](#_bookmark219)on page [154](#_bookmark219)) * load() (see [*load() (method)* ](#_bookmark236)on page [163](#_bookmark236)) * [*load() and loadXML() Method Comparison* ](#_bookmark239)(on page [164](#_bookmark238)) * loadXML() (see [*loadXML() (method)* ](#_bookmark242)on page [167](#_bookmark242)) * src (see [*src (property)* ](#_bookmark371)on page [252](#_bookmark371)) * [*XML Parser* Object ](#_bookmark563)on page [437](#_bookmark563)  ## XMLParserObject (object)  **Description**  WebLOAD provides an embedded, third-party XML parser object to improve the multi-platform support for XML parsing within the WebLOAD environment. The XML parser object can be used instead of MSXML and Java XML parsing, resulting in lower memory consumption and increased performance during load testing.  The XML parser object can be used to reference any element in an XML document. For example, you can use the XML parser object to generate an Excel file containing the desired details of a specified element.  WebLOAD uses the Open Source Xerces XML parser (see [http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/](http://xml.apache.org/xerces\u001ec/)).  The parse() method, not exposed by the original XML parser, is exposed by WebLOAD. This method is identical to the parseURI() method, except that it receives an XML string instead of a URI.  For more information on the XMLParserObject see [*XML Parser* Object ](#_bookmark563)on page [437](#_bookmark563).  **Syntax**  The XML parser object is instanced as follows:  xmlObject = new XMLParserObject();  **Example**  For a detailed example of the implementation of the XML parser object, refer to  [*Example* ](#_bookmark566)on page [443.](#_bookmark566)  **Methods and Properties**  * For a list of the XMLParserObject\u2019s methods, see [*Methods* ](#_bookmark564)on page [438](#_bookmark564). * For a list of the XMLParserObject\u2019s properties, see [*Properties* ](#_bookmark565)on page [442](#_bookmark565)."},{"location":"javascript/appendix_a/","title":"Appendix A: WebLOAD-supported SSL Protocol Versions","text":""},{"location":"javascript/appendix_a/#ssl-handshake-combinations","title":"SSL Handshake Combinations","text":"<p>WebLOAD supports a variety of SSL versions, ranging from the earlier SSL versions and up to the most current TLS versions.

mode of the DES encryption algorithm that encrypts data  three times. ADH Anonymous Diffie Hellman:  The base Diffie-Hellman algorithm is used, but with no authentication. AES Advanced Encryption Standard. CBC Cipher Block Chaining encryption mode. DES Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a cipher (a  method for encrypting information). DH Diffie-Hellman key  exchange is a cryptographic protocol that enables two parties that have no  prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over  an insecure communications channel. This key can then be used to encrypt  subsequent communications using a symmetric key cipher. DHE Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman  key exchange that creates ephemeral (one- time) secret keys. This is possibly  the most secure of the three Diffie- Hellman options because it results in a  temporary, authenticated key. DSS Digital Signature Standard. DSS is a United States  Federal Government standard for digital signatures. ECDH Elliptic Curve  Diffie-Hellman is a key agreement protocol that enables two parties to  establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel. This key can then be  used to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric key cipher. ECDH  is a variant of the Diffie-Hellman protocol using elliptic curve  cryptography. ECDSA Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. Fortezza Fortezza is an information security system  developed by the United States Federal Government. Fortezza PC Card security  tokens contain an NSA- approved security microprocessor called Capstone  (MYK-80) that implements the Skipjack encryption algorithm. GCM Galois/Counter Mode for  symmetric key cryptographic block ciphers. It combines the well-known counter  mode of encryption with the new Galois mode of authentication. IDEA International Data Encryption Algorithm  (IDEA). IDEA is a block cipher. MD5 Message-Digest algorithm 5. RC2 Block cipher with a variable size key. RC4 Software stream cipher (also known as ARC4  or ARCFOUR). RSA An algorithm for public-key encryption. SHA1 Secure Hash Algorithm 1.

The information returned with a 200 response is dependent on  the method used in the request. For example:  GET-an entity corresponding  to the requested resource is sent in the  response  HEAD-the entity-header fields  corresponding to the requested resource are sent in the response without any  message-body  POST-an entity describing or  containing the result of the action  TRACE-an entity containing the  request message as received by the end server 201  _Created The request has been  fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created. The newly created  resource can be referenced by the URI(s) returned in the entity of the  response, with the most specific URI for the resource identified by the Location header field.  A 201 response should include an entity containing a list of resource  characteristics and location(s) from which the user or user agent can choose  the one most appropriate. The entity format is specified by the media type  identified in the Content-Type header field. The origin  server must create the resource before returning a 201 status code. If the  action cannot be carried out immediately, the server should respond with 202 (Accepted) response instead.  A 201 response may contain an ETag  response  header field indicating the current value of the entity tag for the requested  variant just created. 202  Accepted The request has been accepted for  processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request may or may  not eventually be acted upon, depending on whether or not it is authorized or  disallowed when processing actually takes place. There is no facility for re-  sending a status code from an asynchronous operation such as this.  The 202 response is intentionally non-committal.  Its purpose is to allow a server to accept a request for some other process  (perhaps a batch-oriented process that is only run once per day) without  requiring that the user agent\u2019s connection to the server persist until the  process is completed. The entity returned with this response should include  an indication of the request\u2019s current status and either a pointer to a  status monitor or some estimate of when the user can expect the request to be  fulfilled. 203  Non-Authoritative Information The metainformation being  returned in the entity-header is not the definitive set that is usually  obtained from the origin server. This information has been gathered from a  local or a third-party copy. The set presented may be a subset or superset of  the original version. For example, including local annotation information  about the resource might result in a superset of the metainformation known by  the origin server. Use of this response code is not required and is only  appropriate when the response would otherwise be a generic (perhaps  non-informative) 200 (OK). 204  No Content The server has fulfilled  the request, does not need to return an entity- body, and might want to  return updated metainformation. The response may include new or updated  metainformation in the form of entity-headers, which if present should be  associated with the requested variant.  If the client is a user  agent, it should not change its  document view from that which caused the request to be sent. This  response is primarily intended to allow input for actions to take place  without causing a change to the user agent\u2019s active document view, although  any new or updated metainformation should be applied to the document  currently in the user agent\u2019s active view.  The 204 response must not include a message-body, and thus  is always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields. 205  Reset Content The server has fulfilled the request and the user  agent should reset the document view which  caused the request to be sent. This response is primarily intended to allow  input for actions to take place via user input, followed by a clearing of the  form in which the input is entered so that the user can easily initiate  another input action. The response must not include an entity. 206  Partial Content The server has fulfilled the partial GET request for the resource. The request must have  included a Range header field indicating  the desired range. The request may have also included an If-  Range header field to make the  request conditional.  The response must include one of the following  header fields:   Content-Range header field indicating the range included with  this response.   A multipart/byteranges Content-Type field including  Content-Range fields for each part.  If a Content-Length  header field  is present in the response, its value must match the actual number of OCTETs  transmitted in the message-body.   Date   ETag and/or Content-Location, if the header would have  been sent in a 200 response to the same request   Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary, if the field-value might differ from that  sent in any previous response for the same  variant.  If the 206 response is the result of an If-Range request that used a strong cache validator, the  response should not include other entity- headers. If the response is the  result of an If-Range request that used a weak  validator, the response must not include other entity- headers; this prevents  inconsistencies between cached entity-bodies and updated headers. Otherwise,  the response must include all of the entity-headers that would have been  returned with a 200 (OK) response to the same  request.  A cache must not combine a  206 response with other previously cached content if the ETag or Last-Modified headers do not match exactly.  A cache that does not  support Range and  Content-Range headers must not cache 206 (Partial) responses."},{"location":"javascript/appendix_c/#redirection-3xx","title":"Redirection 3XX","text":"<p>The 3XX class of status code indicates that further action needs to be taken by the user agent in order to fulfill the request. The action required may be carried out by the user agent without interaction with the user if and only if the method used in the second request is GET or HEAD. A client should detect infinite redirection loops, since such loops generate network traffic for each redirection.</p> <p>Note: Previous versions of this specification recommended a maximum of five redirections. Content developers should be aware that there might be clients that implement such a fixed limitation.</p> Message Description 300  Multiple Choices The requested resource corresponds to any  one of a set of representations, each with its own specific location.  Agent-driven negotiation information is being provided so that the user (or  user agent) can select a preferred representation and redirect its request to  that location.  Unless it was a HEAD  request, the  response should include an entity containing a list of resource  characteristics and location(s) from which the user or user agent can choose  the one most appropriate. The entity format is specified by the media type  identified in the Content-Type header field. Depending  upon the format and the capabilities of the user agent, the most appropriate  choice may be selected automatically. However, this specification does not  define any standard for such automatic selection.  If the server has a  preferred choice of representation, it should include the specific URI for  that representation in the  Location field. User agents may use the Location field value for automatic redirection. This  response is cacheable unless otherwise indicated. 301  Moved Permanently The requested resource has  been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource  should use one of the returned URIs. Clients with link editing capabilities  ought to automatically re- link references to the Request-URI  to one or  more of the new references returned by the server, where possible. This  response is cacheable unless otherwise indicated.  The new permanent URI  should be identified by the Location field  in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the  response should contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new  URI(s).  If the 301 status code is received in response to a request  other than GET or HEAD, the user agent must not  automatically redirect the request unless it can be confirmed by the user,  since this might change the conditions under which the request was issued.  Note: When automatically  redirecting a POST request after receiving a 301 status code, some existing HTTP/1.0 user agents  will erroneously change it into a GET request. 302  Found The requested resource temporarily resides under a different  URI. Since the redirection might be altered on occasion, the client should  continue to use the Request-URI for  future requests. This response is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or  Expires header field.  The temporary URI should  be identified by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the  response should contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new  URI(s).  If the 302 status code is received in response to a request  other than GET or HEAD, the user agent must not  automatically redirect the request unless it can be confirmed by the user,  since this might change the conditions under which the request was issued.  Note: RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 specify that the client is not allowed to  change the method on the redirected request. However, most existing user  agent implementations treat 302 as if it were a 303 response,  performing a GET on the  Location field-value regardless of the original request  method. The status codes 303 and 307 have  been added for servers that wish to make unambiguously clear which kind of  reaction is expected of the client. 303  See Other The response to the  request can be found under a different URI and should be retrieved using a GET  method on  that resource. This method exists primarily to allow the output of a POST-activated script to  redirect the user agent to a selected resource. The new URI is not a substitute reference for the  originally requested resource. The 303 response must not be  cached, but the response to the second (redirected) request might be cacheable.  The different URI should  be identified by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the  response should contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new  URI(s).  Note: Many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not understand the 303 status. When interoperability with such clients is  a concern, the 302 status code may be used instead, since most user agents react to a 302 response as described here for 303. 304  Not Modified If the client has  performed a conditional GET request and access is allowed, but the  document has not been modified, the server should respond with this status  code. The 304 response  must not contain a message-body, and thus is always terminated by the first  empty line after the header fields.  The response must include the following header  fields:   Date, unless its omission is required. f a  clockless origin server obeys these rules, and proxies and clients add their  own Date to any response received without one, (as already  specified by [RFC 2068]), caches  will operate correctly.   ETag and/or  Content-Location, if the header would have  been sent in a 200 response to the same request.   Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary, if the field-value might differ from that  sent in any previous response for the same  variant.  If the conditional GET  used a strong  cache validator, the response should not include other entity-headers. If the  conditional GET used  a weak validator, the response must not  include other entity-headers.  This prevents  inconsistencies between cached entity-bodies and updated headers.  If a 304 response indicates an  entity not currently cached, then the cache must disregard the response and  repeat the request without the conditional.  If a cache uses a received  304 response to update a cache  entry, the cache must update the entry to reflect any new field values given in the  response. 305  Use Proxy The requested resource  must be accessed through the proxy identified by the Location field. The Location field gives the URI  of the proxy. The recipient is expected to repeat this single request via the proxy. 305 responses must only be generated by origin  servers.  Note: RFC 2068 did not clearly state that 305 was intended to redirect a single request, and to  be generated by origin servers only. Nevertheless, not observing these  limitations has significant security consequences. 306  (Unused) The 306 status code was used in a  previous version of the specification. This code is currently not in use.  However, the code is reserved for future application. 307  Temporary Redirect The requested resource  resides temporarily under a different URI. Since the redirection may be  altered on occasion, the client should continue to use the Request-URI for future requests. This response is only  cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or  Expires header field.  The temporary URI should  be identified by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the  response should contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new  URI(s), since many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not understand the 307  status.  Therefore, the note should contain the information necessary for a user to  repeat the original request on the new URI.  If the 307 status code is received in response to a request  other than GET or HEAD, the user agent must not  automatically redirect the request unless it can be confirmed by the user,  since this might change the conditions under which the request was issued."},{"location":"javascript/appendix_c/#client-error-4xx","title":"Client Error 4XX","text":"<p>The 4XX class of status code is intended for cases in which the client seems to have erred.

The client should not  repeat the request without modifications. 401  Unauthorized The request requires user  authentication. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate  header field  containing a challenge applicable to the  requested resource. The client may repeat the request with a suitable Authorization  header field.  If the request already included Authorization credentials, then the 401  response  indicates that authorization has been refused for those credentials. If the 401  response  contains the same challenge as the prior response, and the user agent has  already attempted authentication at least  once, then the user should be presented the entity that was identified  in the response, since that entity might include relevant diagnostic  information. 402  Payment Required This code is reserved for future use. 403  Forbidden The server understood the  request, but is refusing to fulfill it. Authorization will not help and the  request should not be repeated. If  the request method was not HEAD and the server wishes to make public why  the request has not been fulfilled, it should describe the reason for the  refusal in the entity. If the server does not wish to make this information  available to the client, the status code  404 (Not Found) can be used instead. 404  Not Found The server has not found anything matching  the Request-URI. No indication is given  of whether the condition is temporary or permanent. The 410  (Gone) status code should be  used if the server knows, through some internally configurable mechanism,  that an old resource is permanently unavailable and has no forwarding  address. This status code is essentially a generic, neutral response,  commonly used when the server does not wish to reveal exactly why the request  has been refused, or when no other response is applicable. 405  Method Not Allowed The method specified in  the Request-Line is not allowed for the  resource identified by the Request-URI. The response must  include an Allow header  containing a list of valid methods for the requested resource. 406  Not Acceptable The resource identified by  the request is only capable of generating  response entities which have content characteristics not acceptable according  to the accept headers sent in the request.  Unless it was a HEAD request, the response should include an entity  containing a list of available entity characteristics and location(s) from  which the user or user agent can choose the one most appropriate. The entity  format is specified by the media type identified in the Content-Type header field. Depending upon the format and the  capabilities of the user agent, selection of the most appropriate choice may  be performed automatically. However, this specification does not define any  standard for such automatic selection.  Note: HTTP/1.1 servers are allowed to return responses which are not  acceptable according to the Accept Headers sent in the request. In some  cases, this may even be preferable to sending a 406  response.  User agents are encouraged to inspect the headers of an incoming response to  determine if it is acceptable. If the response could be unacceptable, a user  agent should temporarily stop receipt of more data and query the user for a  decision on further actions. 407  Proxy Authentication  Required This code is similar to 401  (Unauthorized), but indicates that the  client must first authenticate itself with the proxy. The proxy must return a  Proxy-Authenticate header field containing a  challenge applicable to the proxy for the requested resource. The client may  repeat the request with a suitable Proxy-Authorization  header field. 408  Request Timeout The client did not produce  a request within the time that the server was prepared to wait. The client  may repeat the request without modifications at any later time. 409  Conflict The request could not be  completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource. This code  is only allowed in situations where it is expected that the user might be  able to resolve the conflict and resubmit the request. The response body should  include enough information for the user to recognize the source of the  conflict.  Ideally, the response entity would include enough  information for the user or user agent to fix the problem; however, that  might not be possible and is not required.  Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to  a PUT request. For example, if  versioning were being used and the entity being PUT included changes to a resource which  conflict with those made by an earlier (third-party) request, the server  might use the 409 response to indicate that it can\u2019t complete the  request. In this case, the response entity would likely contain a list of the  differences between the two versions in a format defined by the response Content-Type. 410  Gone The requested resource is  no longer available at the server and no forwarding address is known. This  condition should be considered permanent. Clients with link editing  capabilities should delete references to the Request-URI after user approval. If the server does not know,  or has no facility to determine, whether or not the condition is permanent,  the status code 404 (Not Found) should be used instead.  This response is cacheable unless indicated otherwise.  The 410 response is primarily intended to assist  the task of web maintenance by notifying the recipient that the resource is  intentionally unavailable and that the server owners desire that remote links  to that resource be removed. Such an event is common for limited-time,  promotional services and for resources belonging to individuals no longer  working at the server\u2019s site. It is not necessary to mark all permanently  unavailable resources as \u201cgone\u201d or to keep the mark for any length of  time-that is left to the discretion of the server owner. 411  Length Required The server refuses to  accept the request without a defined Content-Length. The client may repeat  the request if it adds a valid Content-Length header field containing the length of the  message-body in the request message. 412  Precondition Failed The precondition given in  one or more of the request-header fields evaluated to false  when it was  tested on the server. This response code allows the client to place  preconditions on the current resource metainformation (header field data) and  thus prevent the requested method from being applied to a resource other than  the one intended. 413  Request Entity Too Large The server is refusing to  process a request because the request entity is larger than the server is  willing or able to process. The server may close the connection to prevent  the client from continuing the request.  If the condition is  temporary, the server should include a Retry- After header field to indicate that it is temporary and  after what time period has elapsed may the client try again. 414  Request-URI Too Long The server is refusing to  service the request because the Request- URI is longer than the server is willing to interpret.  This rare condition is only likely to occur when a client has improperly  converted a POST request to a GET request with long query information, when  the client has descended into a URI \u201cblack hole\u201d of redirection (for example,  a redirected URI prefix that points to a suffix of itself), or when the  server is under attack by a client attempting to exploit security holes  present in some servers using fixed-length buffers for reading or  manipulating the Request-URI. 415  Unsupported Media Type The server is refusing to service the request  because the entity of the request is in a format not supported by the  requested resource for the requested method. 416  Requested Range Not  Satisfiable A server should return a response with this  status code if:   A request included a Range request-header field.   None of the  range-specifier values in this field overlap the current extent of the selected resource.   The  request did not include an If-Range request-header field. For  byte-ranges, this means that the first-byte-pos of all of the  byte-range-spec values were greater than  the current length of  the selected resource.

The implication is that this is a temporary condition which will  be alleviated after some delay. If known, the length of the delay may be indicated  in a Retry-After header. If no Retry-After is given, the client should handle the response as it would for a 500 response.Note: The existence of the 503 status code does not imply that a server must use it  when becoming overloaded.

It is replaced by WebLOAD Recorder. Aborted  Rounds The number of times the  Virtual Clients started to run a script but did not complete the script,  during the last reporting interval. This might be due to a session being  stopped either automatically or manually by the user. script Specification of the sequence of HTTP  protocol calls sent by Virtual Clients to the SUT (System Under Test).  Scripts are written in JavaScript. You can either  write scripts as a text file or generate them automatically using the WebLOAD  Recorder. Application Being Tested  (ABT) See SUT. Attempted  Connections The total number of times  the Virtual Clients attempted to connect to the SUT during the last reporting  interval. Automatic Transaction  counters If you have Automatic  Transactions enabled, WebLOAD creates three counters for each GET and POST  statement in the script:    The total number of times  it occurred   The number of times it succeeded   The number of times it  failed during the last reporting interval. Average For timers, average is the  total amount of time counted by the timer (not the elapsed time) divided by  the Count (that is, the total number of readings). For example, the average  for Transaction Time is the amount of time it took to complete all the  successful transactions, divided by the number of successful transactions  (the Count). Built-in  Timer A timer measures the time  required to perform a given task. WebLOAD supports both programmed timers and  built-in timers. ROUND TIME is a built-in timer. The ROUND TIME is the time  needed for one complete execution of a script. Connect Time The time it takes for a  Virtual Client to connect to the System Under Test (the SUT), in seconds. In  other words, the time it takes from the beginning of the HTTP request to the  TCP/IP connection.  The value posted in the  Current Value column is the average time it took a Virtual Client to connect  to the SUT during the last reporting interval.  If the Persistent  Connection option is enabled, there may not be a value for Connect Time  because the HTTP connection remains open between successive HTTP requests. Connection Speed (Bits Per  Second) The number of bits  transmitted back and forth between the Virtual Clients and the System Under  Test (SUT), divided by the time it took to transmit those bits, in seconds.  You can set the Virtual  Clients to emulate a particular connection speed during the test, either by  using the Variable Connection Speed settings, or by coding the connection  speed in the script.  If a connection speed is specified for the test,  WebLOAD reports it in the Statistics Report.  The value posted in the Current Value column is  the number (sum) of bits passed per second during the last reporting  interval. It should match, very closely, the connection speed you specified  for the test. Console The  WebLOAD component that manages the test session. The Console performs the  following:   Configures Load Session  hosts and scripts   Schedules Load Session scripts   Configures Goal\u2013Oriented  test sessions   Monitors the application's  performance under the generated  load   Manages the Load Session  as it is running, allowing you to pause, stop, and continue Load Session  components as needed   Displays the current  performance of the SUT   Provides a final  performance reports for Probing Clients and Virtual Clients   Manages exporting of  performance reports Count (For timers only.) The  total number of readings (the number of times the item being timed has  occurred) for the timed statistic since the beginning of the test. For  example, for Transaction Time, Count shows the number of transactions that  have been completed. Current  Slice The value posted for this  reporting interval in the Statistics Report main window. Current  Slice Average For per time unit statistics and counters,  average is the total of all of the current values for the last reporting  interval, divided by the number of readings.  For timers, average is the  total amount of time counted by the timer (not the elapsed time), divided by  the Count (that is, the total number of readings for the last reporting  interval). For example, the average for Transaction Time is the amount of  time it took to complete all the successful transactions in the last  reporting interval, divided by the number of successful transactions (the  Current Slice Count). Current  Slice Count (For timers only.) The  total number of readings (the number of times the item being timed has  occurred) for the timed statistic for the last reporting interval. For  example, for Transaction Time, Current Slice Count shows the number of  transactions that have been completed over the last reporting interval. Current  Slice Max The highest value reported for this  statistic over the last reporting interval. Current  Slice Min The lowest value reported for this  statistic over the last reporting interval. Current Slice Standard Deviation The average amount the  measurement for this statistic varies from the average over the last  reporting interval. Current  Slice Sum The aggregate or total  value for this statistic in this script over the last reporting interval. DNS Lookup Time The time it takes to  resolve the host name and convert it to an IP address by calling the DNS  server. Failed Connections The total number of times  the Virtual Clients tried to connect to the SUT but were unsuccessful, during  the last reporting interval.  This number is always less  than or equal to the number of failed hits because hits can fail for reasons  other than a failed connection. Failed Hits The total number of times  the Virtual Clients made an HTTP request but did not receive the correct HTTP  response from the SUT during the last reporting interval. Note that each  request for each gif, jpeg, html  file, etc.,  is a single hit. Failed Hits  Per Second The number of times the  Virtual Clients did not obtain the correct HTTP response, divided by the  elapsed time, in seconds.  The value posted in the Current Value column is  the number (sum) of unsuccessful HTTP requests per second during the last  reporting interval. Failed Pages Per Second The number of times the  Virtual Clients did not obtain the correct response to an upper level  request, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.  The value posted in the  Current Value column is the number (sum) of unsuccessful requests per second  during the last reporting interval. Failed Rounds The total number of times  the Virtual Clients started but did not complete the script during the last  reporting interval. Failed  Rounds Per Second The number of times the  Virtual Clients started but did not complete an iteration of the script,  divided by the elapsed time, in seconds. The value posted in the Current  Value column is the number (sum) of failed iterations of the script per  second during the last reporting interval. First Byte The time it takes a  Virtual Client to receive the first byte of data. Goal\u2013Oriented Test A WebLOAD component  enabling you to define the performance goals required, and view the status of  your application when it is operating under this performance goal. WebLOAD  provides a Goal\u2013Oriented Test Wizard for configuring these performance goals.  WebLOAD automatically accelerates the number of Virtual Clients accessing  your website until you meet your performance goal.  Note: The Goal-Oriented Test Wizard was previously called the Cruise  Control Wizard. Goal\u2013Oriented  Test Wizard See Goal\u2013Oriented   Test. Hit Time The time it takes to  complete a successful HTTP request, in seconds. Each request for each gif, jpeg, html  file, etc.,  is a single hit. The time of a hit is the sum of the Connect Time, Send Time,  Response Time, and Process Time.  The value posted in the Current  Value column is the average time it took to make an HTTP request and process  its response during the last reporting interval. Hits The total number of times the Virtual Clients made HTTP requests to the System Under Test  (SUT) during the last reporting interval.  For example, a Get  statement for a URL retrieves a page. The page can include any number of  graphics and contents files. Each request for each gif, jpeg, html file, etc., is a single hit. Hits Per  Second The number of times the Virtual Clients  made an HTTP request, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds. Each request  for each gif, jpeg, html file, etc. is a single hit.  The value posted in the  Current Value column is the number (sum) of HTTP requests per second during  the last reporting interval. Host A computer connected via a  network, participating in a test session. Each Host in a test session has  assigned tasks. A host can act as either a Load Machine or a Probing Client  Machine. All hosts participating in a test session must be accessible to the Console  over a network. Therefore they must run TestTalk, the network agent. HTTP  Response Status WebLOAD creates a row in  the Statistics Report for each kind of HTTP status code it receives as an  HTTP response from the SUT (redirection codes, success codes, server error  codes, or client error codes).  The value posted is the  number of times the Virtual Clients received that status code during the last  reporting interval. Integrated Report A single configurable  report that can integrate both standard performance data, and data from the  NT Performance Monitor. This report gives you a more complete picture of the  performance of your application. The data to be monitored and the data to be  displayed in the report are both configurable in the Console. Internet  Productivity Pack (IPP) Provides a set of protocol  implementations enabling you to load-test your application using these  protocols. Java and ActiveX counters You can add function calls  to your scripts that enable you to instantiate and call methods and  properties in Java and ActiveX components (see the WebLOAD Scripting Guide). If there are ActiveX or Java function  calls in the script that you are running, WebLOAD reports three counters for  them in the Statistics Report:   The total number of times  it occurred   The number of times it succeeded   The number of times it  failed during the last reporting interval.  The row heading in the  Statistics Report is the name of the function call. Java and  ActiveX timers You can add function calls  to your scripts that enable you to instantiate and call methods and  properties in Java and ActiveX components (see the WebLOAD Scripting Guide). If there are ActiveX or Java function  calls in the script you are running, WebLOAD reports timers for them in the  Statistics Report.  The timer value is the average amount of time it  took to complete the function call, in seconds, during the last reporting  interval.  The row heading in the  Statistics Report is the name of the function call. Load  Generator The component of the Load  Machine that generates Virtual Clients. Load Generators have the task of  bombarding the System Under Test with HTTP protocol call requests as defined  in the script. WebLOAD assesses the application's performance by measuring  the response time experienced by  the Virtual Clients. The number of Virtual Clients at any given moment is  determined by the user. Load  Generator Machine See Load   Machine. Load Machine A host that runs Load Generators. Load Generators  bombard the application under test with a large load, to enable complete  scalability and integrity testing. Load Session A Load Session includes  both the complete Load Template and the results obtained while running that  Load Session. A Load Template consists of information about the hosts and  scripts participating in the current Load Session. The Load Template will  also include scheduling information. The complete Load Template is  illustrated in the Session Tree. Storing a Load Template saves you time when  repeatedly running WebLOAD with the same, or even a similar network  configuration, since you don't have to recreate your Load Template from  scratch each time you want to start working.  Storing Load Session  results can be useful when you want to examine results from multiple test  sessions or for analyzing test session results. Load Size The number of Virtual  Clients running during the last reporting interval. Load  Template A Load Template contains  the complete Load Session definition, without the test results. A Load  Template includes information about the participating hosts and the scripts  used in the current Load Session. The definition also includes scheduling  information and the configuration of the Server Monitor and Integrated  Reports. The complete Load Template is illustrated in the Session Tree.  Storing a Load Template saves you time when repeatedly running WebLOAD with  the same, or even a similar network configuration, since you do not have to  recreate your Load Template from scratch each time you rerun a test. Page Time The time it takes to  complete a successful upper level request, in seconds. The Page Time is the  sum of the Connection Time, Send Time, Response Time, and Process Time for  all the hits on a page.  The value posted in the Current Value column is  the average time it took the Virtual Clients to make an upper level request  and process its response during the last reporting interval. Pages The total number of times the Virtual  Client made upper level requests, both successful and unsuccessful, during  the last reporting interval. Pages Per Second The number of times the  Virtual Clients made upper level requests divided by the elapsed time, in  seconds.  The value posted in the  Current Value column is the number  (sum) of requests per second during the last  reporting interval. Per Time  Unit statistics Ratios that calculate an  average value for an action or process. For example: Transactions Per Second,  Rounds Per Second. Portfolio A Portfolio of reports enables you to  generate a single, inclusive report that contains all the charts generated by  the templates included in the portfolio. Probing Client A software program which  \"bombards\" the SUT as a single Virtual Client, to further measure  the performance of the SUT. WebLOAD generates exact values for Probing Client  performance. Probing  Client Machines Hosts running Probing Client software  simulating one Virtual Client, and running at the same time as Load Machines. Probing  Client software See Probing   Client. Process Time The time it takes WebLOAD to parse an HTTP  response from the SUT and then populate the document-object model (DOM), in  seconds.  The value posted in the  Current Value column is the average time it took WebLOAD to parse an HTTP  response during the last reporting interval. Receive Time The elapsed time between receiving the  first byte and the last byte. Report  Portfolio See Portfolio. Resource Manager Distributes and circulates  WebLOAD testing resources (Virtual Clients and Probing Clients) amongst users  on a \"need to use\" basis. The Resource Manager is packaged with a  maximum number of Virtual Clients, Probing Clients and Connected Workstation  ports, as defined by the WebLOAD package.  With the Resource Manager,  every WebLOAD Console can operate in Standalone Workstation mode or Connected  Workstation mode. Response  Data Size The size, in bytes, of all  the HTTP responses sent by the SUT during the last reporting interval.  WebLOAD uses this value to  calculate Throughput (bytes per second). Response  Time The time it takes the SUT  to send the object of an HTTP request back to a Virtual Client, in seconds.  In other words, the time from the end of the HTTP request until the Virtual  Client has received the complete item it requested.  The value posted in the Current  Value column is the average time  it took the SUT to respond to an HTTP request during the last reporting interval. Responses The number of times the  SUT responded to an HTTP request during the last reporting interval.  This number should match the number of successful  hits. Round Time The time it takes one  Virtual Client to finish one complete iteration of a script, in seconds.  The value posted in the  Current Value column is the average time it took the Virtual Clients to  finish one complete iteration of the script during the last reporting  interval. Rounds The total number of times  the Virtual Clients attempted to run the script during the last reporting  interval. Rounds Per Second The number of times the  Virtual Clients attempted to run the script, divided by the elapsed time, in  seconds.  The value posted in the  Current Value column is the number (sum) of attempts (both successful and  unsuccessful) per second during the last reporting interval. Send Time The time it takes the Virtual Client to  write an HTTP request to the SUT, in seconds.  The value posted in the  Current Value column is the average time it took the Virtual Clients to write  a request to the SUT during the last reporting interval. Server  Performance Measurements If you selected  Performance Monitor statistics for the report, WebLOAD creates a row for them  and reports their values in the  Statistics Report.  For definitions of the  statistics, see the Server Monitor  Definition dialog box.  Be selective when choosing  server performance measurements , otherwise the system resources required to  manage the data might affect the Console. Session Tree A graphic representation  of a Load Template and status. It illustrates the different components of a  test session, including Load Machines and Probing Clients, the scripts that  they execute, and their status. Single  Client See Probing   Client. Standard  Deviation The average amount the measurement varies  from the average since the beginning of the test. Successful  Connections The total number of times the Virtual  Clients were able to successfully  connect to the SUT during the last reporting interval.  This number is always less  than or equal to the number of successful hits because several hits might use  the same HTTP connection if the  Persistent Connection option is enabled. Successful  Hits The total number of times the Virtual  Clients made an HTTP request and received the correct HTTP response from the  SUT during the last reporting interval. Each request for each gif, jpeg, html file, etc., is a single hit. Successful  Hits Per Second The number of times the  Virtual Clients obtained the correct HTTP response to their HTTP requests  divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.  The value posted in the  Current Value column is the number (sum) of successful HTTP requests per  second during the last reporting interval. Successful  Pages Per Second The value posted in the  Current Value column is the number (sum) of successful requests per second  during the last reporting interval. Successful  Rounds The total number of times  the Virtual Clients completed one iteration of the script during the last  reporting interval. Successful  Rounds Per Second The number of times the  Virtual Clients completed an entire iteration of the script, divided by the  elapsed time, in seconds.  The value posted in the  Current Value column is the number (sum) of successful iterations of the  script per second during the last reporting interval. SUT The system running the Web  application currently under test. The SUT (System Under Test) is accessed by  clients through its URL address. The SUT can reside on any machine or on  multiple machines, anywhere on the global Internet or your local intranet. Template See Load   Template. Templates Gallery The Templates Gallery is a single entity  that contains predefined templates, user-defined templates, and portfolios. Test Program See Test Script. Test Script The script. This defines  the test scenario used in your Load Session. Scripts are written in  JavaScript. Test  Template See Load   Template. TestTalk The network agent. This  program enables communication between the Console and the host computers  participating in the test. Throttle  Control A WebLOAD component that  enables you to dynamically change the Load Size while a test session is in  progress. Throughput  (Bytes Per Second) The average number of  bytes per second transmitted from the SUT to the Virtual Clients running the  script during the last reporting interval. In other words, this is the amount  of the Response Data Size, divided by the number of seconds in the reporting interval. Time to  First Byte The time that elapsed  since a request was sent until the Virtual Client received the first byte of  data. User-defined Automatic Data Collection If you have Automatic Data  Collection enabled, WebLOAD creates three counters for each GET and POST  statement in the script:   The total number of times  the Get and Post statements occurred   The number of times the  statements succeeded   The number of times the  statements failed during the last  reporting interval. User-defined  counters Your own counters that you  can add to scripts using the SendCounter() and the SendMeasurement()  functions  (see the WebLOAD Scripting Guide).  If there is a user-defined counter in the script that you are running,  WebLOAD reports the counter\u2019s values in the Statistics Report.  The row heading is the  name (argument) of the counter. That is, the row heading is the string in  parenthesis in the SendCounter() or SendMeasurement() function call.  The value reported is the  number of times the counter was incremented during the last reporting  interval. User-defined  timer Timers that you can add to  scripts to keep track of the amount of time it takes to complete specific  actions (see the WebLOAD Scripting  Guide). If there are any timers in the scripts that you are running,  WebLOAD reports their values in the Statistics Report.  The row heading is the  name (argument) of the timer. That is, the row heading is the string in  parenthesis in the SetTimer() function call. The timer represents the time it takes to complete all  the actions between the SetTimer() call and its corresponding  SendTimer() call, in seconds.  The value posted is the average time it took a  Virtual Client to complete the actions between the pair of timer calls, in  seconds, during the last reporting interval. User-defined Transaction counters Transaction functions that  you can add to scripts for functional tests (see the WebLOAD Scripting Guide). If there is a user-defined transaction  function in the script that you are running, WebLOAD reports three counters  for it in the Statistics Report:   The total number of times  the transaction occurred   The number of times a  transaction succeeded   The number of times a  transaction failed during the  last reporting interval.  The row heading is the  name (argument) of the transaction. That is, the row heading is the string in  parenthesis in the BeginTransaction() function call. User-defined Transactions timers A timer for user-defined  transaction functions. If there is a user-defined transaction function in the  script that you are running, WebLOAD reports a timer for it in the Statistics  Report.  The row heading is the  name (argument) of the user- defined transaction. That is, the row heading is  the string in parenthesis in the BeginTransaction()  function  call.  The timer represents the average time it took to  complete all the actions between the BeginTransaction()  call and its  corresponding EndTransaction() call, in seconds, during  the last reporting interval. Virtual Client Artificial entities run by  Load Generators. Each such entity is a perfect simulation of a real client  accessing the System Under Test  (SUT) through a Web browser.  Virtual Clients generate  HTTP calls that access the SUT. The Load Generators that run Virtual Clients  can reside anywhere on the Internet or on your local intranet.  Scripts are executed by all the Virtual Clients in  parallel, achieving simultaneous access to the SUT. The size of the load on  your SUT is determined by the number of Virtual  Clients being generated. You may define as many Virtual Clients as needed, up  to the maximum supported by your WebLOAD \u201cpackage.\u201d WebLOAD  Analytics WebLOAD Analytics enables  you to analyze data, and create custom, informative reports after running a  WebLOAD test session. WebLOAD Console See Console. WebLOAD Integrated Development Environment (IDE) An easy-to-use tool for  recording, creating, and authoring protocol scripts for the WebLOAD  environment. WebLOAD Wizard A WebLOAD Wizard that  steps you through the configuration process. Each screen of the WebLOAD  Wizard contains text explaining the configuration process. The WebLOAD Wizard  enables you to create a basic Load Template. After using the demo, you can  use the Console menus to add functionality not available through the WebLOAD  Wizard.

You do not need to know anything about writing scripts to test an application with WebLOAD. No programming or editing skills are required to create or run a successful test session.</p> <p>Scripts are created using WebLOAD Recorder. WebLOAD Recorder operates in conjunction with a Web browser such as Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer. As a user navigates the test application in the browser, (for example, navigating between pages, typing text into a form, or clicking the mouse), WebLOAD Recorder records all user actions in a script. During later website testing sessions, WebLOAD simulates every action of the original user and automatically handles all Web interactions, including parsing dynamic HTML, and full support for all security requirements, such as user authentication or SSL protocol use.</p> <p>A simple recorded script is ideal if your WebLOAD test involves a typical sequence of Web activities. These activities are all recorded in your script, and are represented in</p> <p>the WebLOAD Recorder by a Script Tree, a set of clear, intuitive icons and visual devices arranged into a logical hierarchical sequence.

As you execute a sequence of HTTP actions in the browser, WebLOAD Recorder records your actions in a JavaScript script. All Web browsers rely on an extended Document Object Model, or DOM, for optimum handling of HTML pages. The standard browser DOM defines both the logical structure of HTML documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. WebLOAD scripts use a standard browser DOM to access and navigate Internet Web pages, including Dynamic HTML and nested links and pages. To facilitate website testing, WebLOAD extends the standard browser DOM with many features, objects, and functions that expedite site testing and evaluation.</p> <p>This section provides a brief overview of the standard DOM structure. Most of the information in this overview was provided by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which develops interoperable technologies (specifications, guidelines, software, and tools) to lead the Web to its full potential as a forum for information, commerce,</p> <p>communication, and collective understanding.

The DOM defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. With the Document Object Model, programmers can build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content. Anything found in an HTML or XML document can be accessed, changed, deleted, or added using the Document Object Model, with a few exceptions\u2014in particular, the DOM interfaces for the XML internal and external subsets have not yet been specified.</p> <p>As a W3C specification, one important objective for the Document Object Model is to provide a standard programming interface that can be used in a wide variety of environments and applications. The DOM is designed to be used with any programming language.</p> <p>Essentially, the DOM is a programming API for documents based on an object structure that closely resembles the structure of the documents it models. For instance, consider this table, taken from an HTML document:</p> <pre><code>&lt;TABLE&gt;\n\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n\n&lt;TR&gt;\n\n&lt;TD&gt;Shady Grove&lt;/TD&gt;\n\n&lt;TD&gt;Aeolian&lt;/TD&gt;\n\n&lt;/TR&gt;\n\n&lt;TR&gt;\n\n&lt;TD&gt;Over the River, Charlie&lt;/TD&gt;\n\n&lt;TD&gt;Dorian&lt;/TD&gt;\n\n&lt;/TR&gt;\n\n&lt;/TBODY&gt;\n\n&lt;/TABLE&gt;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"javascript/intro_java_scripts/#understanding-the-dom-structure","title":"Understanding the DOM Structure","text":"<p>In the DOM, documents have a logical structure that is very much like a tree; to be more precise, that is like a \u201cforest\u201d or \u201cgrove\u201d, which can contain more than one tree. Each document contains zero or one doctype nodes, one root element node, and zero or more comments or processing instructions; the root element serves as the root of the element tree for the document. However, the DOM does not specify that documents must be implemented as a tree or a grove, nor does it specify how the relationships among objects be implemented. The DOM is a logical model that may be implemented in any convenient manner. In this specification, we use the term structure model to describe the tree-like representation of a document. We also use the term \u201ctree\u201d when referring to the arrangement of those information items which can be reached by using \u201ctree-walking\u201d methods; (this does not include attributes). One important property of DOM structure models is structural isomorphism: if any two Document Object Model implementations are used to create a representation of the same document, they will create the same structure model, in accordance with the XML Information Set [Infoset].</p> <p>Note: There may be some variations depending on the parser being used to build the DOM. For instance, the DOM may not contain white spaces in element content if the parser discards them.</p> <p>The name \u201cDocument Object Model\u201d was chosen because it is an \u201cobject model\u201d in the traditional object oriented design sense. Documents are modeled using objects, and the model encompasses not only the structure of a document, but also the behavior of a document and the objects of which it is composed. In other words, the nodes in the above diagram do not represent a data structure; they represent objects, which have functions and identity. As an object model, the DOM identifies:</p> <ul> <li>The interfaces and objects used to represent and manipulate a document.</li> <li>The semantics of these interfaces and objects - including both behavior and attributes.</li> <li>The relationships and collaborations among these interfaces and objects.</li> </ul> <p>The structure of SGML documents has traditionally been represented by an abstract data model, not by an object model. In an abstract data model, the model is centered around the data. In object oriented programming languages, the data itself is encapsulated in objects that hide the data, protecting it from direct external manipulation. The functions associated with these objects determine how the objects may be manipulated, and they are part of the object model.</p> <p>The information in this section has been excerpted from the World Wide Web Consortium introduction to the DOM.

Browser DOMs were designed to reflect this flexible approach.</p> <p>When using the DOM, a single Web page document has a logical structure that resembles a single tree. In nested Web pages, each child window is simply one tree in a recursive forest of trees. The typical DOM is ideal for representing Internet Web page access because it provides a flexible, generic model that encompasses both the attributes of the object itself and its interfaces and behaviors. Typical DOM objects include:</p> <ul> <li>The document itself.</li> <li>The frames nested in an HTML page, together with any additional nested windows.</li> <li>The location information.</li> <li>The links, forms, and images on the page.</li> <li>The tables, scripts, XML Data Islands, and Meta objects on the page.</li> <li>Individual elements of a specific form or frame.</li> </ul> <p>The following table provides a brief overview of the main DOM object components of a typical Web page.</p> <p>DOM objects commonly used in scripts</p> <p>The following table lists the DOM objects commonly used in scripts. A detailed description of each of these objects can be found in the following sections. </p> Object Description window The window  object  represents an open browser window. Typically, the browser creates a single window  object when  it opens an HTML document. However, if a document defines one or more frames  the browser creates one window object for the original  document and one additional window object (a child window) for each frame. The  child window may be affected by actions that occur in the parent. For  example, closing the parent window causes all child windows to close. document The document  object  represents the HTML document in a browser window, storing the HTML data in a  parsed format. Use the document object to retrieve links,  forms, nested frames, images, scripts, and other information about the  document. By default, document used alone represents the  document in the current window. You usually refer directly to the document;  the window  part is  optional and is understood implicitly. frame Each frame  object  represents one of the frames imbedded within a Web page. Frames and windows  are essentially comparable. The recursive aspect of the DOM is implemented at  this level. A window may contain a collection of frames. Each frame may  contain multiple child windows, each of which may contain more frames that  contain more windows, and so on. location The location object contains  information on the current window URL. link A link object contains  information on an external document to which the current document is linked. form, element, and input A form  object  contains the set of elements and input controls (text, radio buttons,  checkboxes, etc.) that are all components of a single form. Each element  object stores the parsed data for a single HTML form element such as , , or . Each input object  stores the information defining one of the input controls in the form.  Controls are organized by type, for example input type=checkbox.  Forms enable client-side  users to submit data to a server in a standardized format. A form is designed  to collect the required data using a variety of controls, such as INPUT or SELECT. Users viewing the form  fill in the data and then click the SUBMIT button to send it to the server. A script on the server then  processes the data. Notice that the object syntax corresponds to a path  through the DOM hierarchy tree, beginning at the root window and continuing  until the specified item\u2019s properties. image Each image  object  contains one of the embedded images found in a document. script A script  object  defines a script for the current document that will be interpreted by a  script engine. title The title  object  contains the document title, stored as a text string."},{"location":"javascript/intro_java_scripts/#webload-extension-set","title":"WebLOAD Extension Set","text":"<p>WebLOAD has added the following extensions to the standard DOM properties and methods.

A script is initially created by WebLOAD Recorder during a recording session. As a user works with a test application in a browser, (for example, navigating between pages, typing text into a form, or clicking the mouse), WebLOAD Recorder stores information about all user actions in a script. Scripts are also edited using WebLOAD Recorder. Users may add functionality or customize their scripts through the objects, functions, and other features described in this guide.</p> <p>Customizing scripts may involve nothing more than dragging an icon from the WebLOAD Recorder toolbar and dropping it into a graphic representation of the script. It may involve entering or changing data through a user-friendly dialog box, or with the help of a Wizard. Some users may even add special features to their scripts by editing the underlying code of the script itself. When working with scripts, users may be working on many different levels. For that reason, the WebLOAD Recorder desktop includes multiple view options, providing information on multiple levels. See the WebLOAD Scripting Guide for a more extensive, illustrated explanation of the WebLOAD Recorder desktop components.</p> <p>Most users access scripts primarily through a Script Tree, a set of clear, intuitive icons and visual devices representing user activities during a recording session, arranged into a logical structure. Each user activity in the Script Tree is referred to as a node. Nodes are organized in a hierarchical arrangement. The outmost level, or root level, is a single script node. The second level directly under the root script node includes all the Web pages to which the user navigated over the course of the recording session. The third level, organized under each Web page, includes all the</p> <p>user activities that occurred on the parent Web page. These activities are themselves organized into additional levels. For example, all data input on a single form in a Web page is organized into a single sub-tree of user input nodes collected under the node for that form. The Script Tree appears on the left side of the WebLOAD Recorder desktop.</p> <p>Web page nodes are added to the Script Tree in one of two ways. Some Web pages are the result of a user action on the previous page, such as clicking a link and jumping to a new page. Other Web pages are created as a result of direct or indirect navigation, such as entering a URL in the browser window, or pop-up windows triggered by a previous navigation. The sets of user activities contained between two direct-navigation Web pages in a Script Tree parallel the navigation blocks found within the JavaScript script code.</p> <p>During a WebLOAD Recorder recording session, a new navigation block is created each time a user completes a direct navigation, manually entering a new URL into the WebLOAD Recorder address bar. Each navigation block is surrounded by a try{} catch{} statement in the corresponding JavaScript script code.</p> <p>Navigation blocks are useful for error management, especially when running \u201chands-free\u201d test sessions. For example, the user can define the default testing behavior to be that if an error is encountered during a test session, WebLOAD should throw the error, skip to the next navigation block, and continue with the test session. Errors during playback are indicated by a red X appearing beside the problematic action in the Script Tree.</p> <p>The graphic nodes in a Script Tree actually represent blocks of code within the underlying recorded script. The JavaScript code corresponding to a selected node is automatically displayed in the JavaScript View pane. The JavaScript View pane is one of the tabs available in the WebLOAD Recorder desktop.</p> <p>The graphic nodes in a Script Tree represent user actions on a website. An exact replica, or snapshot, of each user activity is stored during recording and available in the Browser View to aid in debugging and help users remember what each action accomplished. The Browser View pane is one of the tabs available in the WebLOAD Recorder desktop.</p> <p>Web pages are created through HTML programs. The HTML code that underlies each stored Web page is also stored during recording sessions. For easy reference, the HTML code of the Web page associated with a selected node is displayed in the HTML View pane. The HTML View pane is one of the tabs available in the WebLOAD Recorder desktop.</p> <p>Web pages have a logical structure that may be represented through a series of DOM object trees. The DOM tree for a selected Web page is essentially a hierarchically structured, more easily understood representation of the DOM objects found in the HTML code for that Web page. The DOM tree of the Web page associated with a selected node is displayed in the DOM View pane. The DOM View pane is one of the tabs available in the WebLOAD Recorder desktop. When</p> <p>working with the DOM View, the center pane is actually split in half, with the upper half displaying the DOM View and the lower half displaying the corresponding Web page, seen in the Browser View.</p> <p>The following figure illustrates a WebLOAD Recorder desktop displaying the Script Tree and DOM and Browser Views. The Script Tree is on the left. The Browser View pane on the lower right focuses on a piece of the selected form as it appeared on the Web page at the time this script was recorded. The DOM View pane on the upper right displays the DOM objects that represent the selected form, arranged in a tree that corresponds to the user activity in the selected form.</p> <p>Figure 1: Script Tree, DOM, and Browser Views</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"javascript/intro_java_scripts/#editing-the-javascript-code-in-a-script","title":"Editing the JavaScript Code in a script","text":""},{"location":"javascript/intro_java_scripts/#accessing-the-javascript-code-within-the-script-tree","title":"Accessing the JavaScript Code within the Script Tree","text":"<p>WebLOAD Recorder provides a complete graphic user interface for creating and editing script files.

The icons on that branch represent all user activities from the point at which that Web page was first accessed until the point at which the user navigated to a different Web page. Some testing features may require manually editing or rewriting the JavaScript code for user activities within a Web page. To manually edit code in a recorded script, the Web page branch that includes that code must be converted to a JavaScript Object. Converting a Web page branch to a JavaScript Object is simple. Right click the preferred Web page node in the Script Tree and select Convert to JavaScript Object from the pop-up menu. The entire Web page branch becomes a single JavaScript Object, which can then be edited through the IntelliSense Editor.</p> <p>Note: Once a branch has been converted to a single JavaScript Object, the various user activity icons that were on that branch are no longer individually accessible.</p> <p>Imported JavaScript File\u2014an external JavaScript file that should be incorporated within the body of the current script.

The IntelliSense Editor helps you write the JavaScript code for a new function by formatting new code and prompting with suggestions and descriptions of appropriate code choices and syntax as programs are being written. IntelliSense supports the following shortcut keys:</p> <p>Period (\u201c.\u201d) \u2013 Enter a period after the object name, to display a drop-down list of the object\u2019s available properties that can be added to the script (see</p> <p>Figure 2).</p> <p>  \u2013 While typing the name of an object, you can type  <p> to display a drop-down list of the available objects that begin with the letters that you entered. For example, if you type wl the IntelliSense Editor displays a drop-down list of all of the objects that begin with wl (such as wlhttp). <p>In addition, the IntelliSense Editor gives a structure to the code with the outline bar and line numbering.</p> <p>Collapsing the code enables you to view the heading of the section, without seeing the code within the section. To expand or collapse different sections of the code:</p> <p>Click the plus sign (+) or minus sign (-) on the outline bar,</p> <p>-Or-</p> <p>Right-click within the IntelliSense Editor and select Outlining from the pop-up menu. The available outlining options are:</p> <p>Toggle outline \u2013 Collapses or expands the section at the mouse location.</p> <p>Toggle all outline \u2013 Collapses or expands all outlines.</p> <p>Collapse to definition \u2013 Collapses all outlines.</p> <p>You can enable or disable both the outline bar and line numbering features by:</p> <p>Selecting Edit \u0086 Enable Outlining or Line Numbers,</p> <p>-Or-</p> <p>Right-clicking within the IntelliSense Editor and selecting Enable Outlining or</p> <p>Line Numbers from the pop-up menu.</p> <p>When these features are enabled, a checkmark appears next to the name in the Edit and pop-up menus. By default, these features are enabled, but WebLOAD opens with the settings that were saved during the previous WebLOAD session. During playback and debug modes, all outlines are expanded.</p> <p>Use WebLOAD Recorder\u2019s predefined delimiters to keep your code structured and organized. The available delimiters include:</p> <p>For JavaScript functions, use the \u201c{\u201c as the start delimiter and the \u201c}\u201d end delimiter.</p> <p>For script tree nodes, insert a WLIDE comment from the General WebLOAD Recorder toolbox. This automatically inserts a start delimiter \u201c//\u201d and end</p> <p>delimiter \u201cEnd WLIDE\u201d.</p> <p>For more information, see the WebLOAD Scripting Guide.</p> <p>Figure 2: IntelliSense Editor Mode for JavaScript View Pane</p> <p>A selection of the most commonly used functions and commands, available through the Insert menu.</p> <p>You can choose to program your own JavaScript Object code within your script and take advantage of the WebLOAD Recorder to simplify your programming efforts. Rather than manually typing out the code for each command, with the risk of making a mistake, even a trivial typographical error, and adding invalid code to the script file, you may select an item from the Insert menu, illustrated in the following figure, to bring up a list of available commands and functions for the selected item. WebLOAD Recorder automatically inserts the correct code for the selected item into the JavaScript Object currently being edited. You may then change specific parameter values without any worries about accidental mistakes in the function syntax.</p> <p>Figure 3: Insert Menu</p> <p>In addition to the Insert menu, you may select an item from the Insert Variable menu, to add system and user-defined parameters to the script.

The classic browser DOM includes a wide range of objects, properties, and methods for maximum utility and versatility. For more information about the standard DOM structure and components, go to the following websites:</p> <ul> <li> <p>http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-DOM-Level-1-20000929/introduction.html</p> </li> <li> <p>http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/author/dom/domov erview.asp</p> </li> <li> <p>http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/author/dhtml/refere nce/dhtmlrefs.asp</p> </li> </ul> <p>Since WebLOAD emulates the HTTP activities included in a test session, WebLOAD supports the standard DOM object set that implements those activities. Only the DOM objects, properties, and methods of special interest to WebLOAD programmers working with test session scripts are listed here. This guide also includes reference material for the objects, properties, and methods that were added by WebLOAD as extensions to the basic DOM, to implement specific test session features.</p> <p>Website testing usually means testing how typical user activities are handled by the application being tested. Are the user actions managed quickly, correctly and appropriately? Is the application responsive to the user\u2019s requests? Will the typical user be happy working with this application? When verifying that an application handles user activities correctly, WebLOAD usually focuses on the user activities, recording user actions through WebLOAD Recorder when initially creating scripts and recreating those actions during subsequent test sessions.

During runtime, WebLOAD measures the time it takes to complete the transaction and reports the results in the WebLOAD Integrated reports, Statistics reports, and Data Drilling report.</p> <p>Note: You can add an unlimited number of transactions into your script, each with a different name.</p> <p>To mark the beginning of a transaction:</p> <ol> <li>Drag the Begin Transaction  icon from the Load toolbox into the Script Tree, directly above the first action you want to include in the transaction.</li> </ol> <p>The Begin Transaction dialog box opens.</p> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>Enter a logical name for the transaction; for example, Login.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click OK.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Begin Transaction item appears in the Script Tree and the JavaScript code is added to the script.

However, for testing purposes, you may wish to create peak server loads that stress your system to the limit by deliberately forcing multiple Virtual Clients to perform key tasks and execute a given command at precisely the same moment in real time.</p> <p>WebLOAD provides Synchronization Points to coordinate the actions of multiple Virtual Clients. A Synchronization Point is a meeting place where Virtual Clients wait before continuing with a script. When one Virtual Client arrives at a Synchronization Point, WebLOAD holds the Client at that point until all the other Virtual Clients arrive. When all the Virtual Clients have arrived, they are all released at once to perform the next action in the script simultaneously.</p> <p>For example, suppose that you want to simulate 500 users, all trying to access a form on the same Web page simultaneously. To maximize the impact of this test situation, all 500 Virtual Clients must access the form at exactly the same time. Add a Synchronization Point before the form entry node to ensure that all the Virtual Clients log in simultaneously.</p> <p>WebLOAD Recorder enables you to define the meeting place where all Virtual Clients wait. You can also optionally set the timeout value, the number of milliseconds that WebLOAD will wait for all of the Virtual Clients to arrive at the Synchronization Point. The timeout is a safety mechanism that prevents an infinite wait if any of the Virtual Clients does not arrive at the Synchronization Point for any reason. Once the timeout period expires, WebLOAD releases the rest of the Virtual Clients. Setting a timeout</p> <p>value is important to ensure that the test session will not \u2018hang\u2019 indefinitely in case of error.</p> <p>To insert a Synchronization Point:</p> <ol> <li>Drag the Synchronization Point  icon from the Load toolbox into the Script Tree directly before the action you want all Virtual Clients to perform simultaneously. The Synchronization Point dialog box opens.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>In the Timeout Value field, enter or select a timeout value for the Synchronization Point.

This value indicates whether the function was successful or not. All failures are logged and displayed in the WebLOAD and Console Log windows, similar to any other WebLOAD test failure.</p> <p>Synchronization Point function calls may return one of the following return values:</p> <ul> <li>WLSuccess\u2014synchronization succeeded. All Virtual Clients arrived at the Synchronization Point and were released together.</li> <li>WLLoadChanged\u2014synchronization failed. A change in the load size was detected while Virtual Clients were being held at the Synchronization Point. All Virtual clients were released.</li> <li>WLTimeout\u2014synchronization failed. The timeout expired before all Virtual Clients arrived at the Synchronization Point. All Virtual Clients were released.</li> <li>WLError\u2014synchronization failed. Invalid timeout value.

Explanations are provided at the bottom of the dialog box for each parameter as it is selected in the dialog box.</p> <p>Note: The values that appear in the Wizard\u2019s Value area are the default values for each field. In most cases, the default value for string variables is an empty string, indicated in the Value area by a set of empty quotation marks. If you are entering your own value for a string field, the new string must also be enclosed within quotation marks. Fields that were not assigned a value in the dialog box are left as empty fields in the script code.</p> <p>Once you have finished defining the new database Building Block, the new activity is reflected in the Script Tree.

Selenium is open-source software, and can be used without charge.</p> <p>WebLOAD enables integration of a Selenium script into WebLOAD, and the gathering of navigation timing statistics. This is useful for gathering information regarding user experience, such as how long it takes to login, or how long it takes a page to render.</p> <p>While WebLOAD simulates the load on a server, Selenium simulates the end-user experience. A hybrid WebLOAD-Selenium solution can thus give you the advantages of both simulation types. To implement such a solution, you can run a WebLOAD load session that does the following:</p> <ul> <li>Runs a regular WebLOAD script with many users.</li> <li>Run a Selenium script that simulates the same actions, for a single user.</li> </ul> <p>The template will gather and display statistics from both scripts in the WebLOAD reports. In order to easily distinguish between the statistics from the regular WebLOAD script and those from the Selenium script, it is recommended to give the transactions in each of the two scripts a different distinctive name.

It is replaced by WebLOAD Recorder. Aborted Rounds The number of times the Virtual Clients started to run a script but did not complete the script, during the last reporting interval. This might be due to a session being stopped either automatically or manually by the user. Script Specification of the sequence of HTTP protocol calls sent by Virtual Clients to the SUT (System Under Test). scripts are written in JavaScript. You can either write scripts as a text file or generate them automatically using the WebLOAD Recorder. Application Being Tested (ABT) See SUT. Attempted Connections The total number of times the Virtual Clients attempted to connect to the SUT during the last reporting interval. Automatic Transaction counters <p>If you have Automatic Transactions enabled, WebLOAD creates three counters for each GET and POST statement in the script:</p><p>- The total number of times it occurred</p><p>- The number of times it succeeded</p><p>- The number of times it failed during the last reporting interval.</p> Average For timers, average is the total amount of time counted by the timer (not the elapsed time) divided by the Count (that is, the total number of readings). For example, the average for Transaction Time is the amount of time it took to complete all the successful transactions, divided by the number of successful transactions (the Count). Built-in Timer A timer measures the time required to perform a given task. WebLOAD supports both programmed timers and built-in timers. ROUND TIME is a built-in timer. The ROUND TIME is the time needed for one complete execution of a script. Connect Time <p>The time it takes for a Virtual Client to connect to the System Under Test (the SUT), in seconds. In other words, the time it takes from the beginning of the HTTP request to the TCP/IP connection.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the average time it took a Virtual Client to connect to the SUT during the last reporting interval.</p><p>If the Persistent Connection option is enabled, there may not be a value for Connect Time because the HTTP connection remains open between successive HTTP requests.</p> Connection Speed (Bits Per Second) <p>The number of bits transmitted back and forth between the Virtual Clients and the System Under Test (SUT), divided by the time it took to transmit those bits, in seconds.</p><p>You can set the Virtual Clients to emulate a particular connection speed during the test, either by using the Variable Connection Speed settings, or by coding the connection speed in the script.</p><p>If a connection speed is specified for the test, WebLOAD reports it in the Statistics Report.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of bits passed per second during the last reporting interval. It should match, very closely, the connection speed you specified for the test.</p> Console <p>The WebLOAD component that manages the test session.</p><p>The Console performs the following:</p><p>- Configures Load Session hosts and scripts</p><p>- Schedules Load Session scripts</p><p>- Configures Goal\u2013Oriented test sessions</p><p>- Monitors the application's performance under the generated load</p><p>- Manages the Load Session as it is running, allowing you to pause, stop, and continue Load Session components as needed</p><p>- Displays the current performance of the SUT</p><p>- Provides a final performance reports for Probing Clients and Virtual Clients</p><p>- Manages exporting of performance reports</p> Count (For timers only.) The  total number of readings (the number of times the item being timed has  occurred) for the timed statistic since the beginning of the test. For  example, for Transaction Time, Count shows the number of transactions that  have been completed. Current  Slice The value posted for this reporting  interval in the Statistics Report main window. Current  Slice Average For per time unit statistics and counters, average is the total of  all of the current values for the last reporting interval, divided by the  number of readings.  For timers, average is the  total amount of time counted by the timer (not the elapsed time), divided by  the Count (that is, the total number of readings for the last reporting  interval). For example, the average for Transaction Time is the amount of  time it took to complete all the successful transactions in the last  reporting interval, divided by the number of successful transactions (the  Current Slice Count). Current  Slice Count (For timers only.) The total number of  readings (the number of times the item being timed has occurred) for the  timed statistic for the last reporting interval. For example, for Transaction  Time, Current Slice Count shows the number of transactions that have been  completed over the last reporting interval. Current  Slice Max The highest value reported for this statistic over the last reporting  interval. Current  Slice Min The lowest value reported for this statistic over the last reporting  interval. Current  Slice Standard Deviation The average amount the measurement for this statistic varies from the  average over the last reporting interval. Current  Slice Sum The aggregate or total  value for this statistic in this script over the last reporting interval. DNS Lookup  Time The time it takes to  resolve the host name and convert it to an IP address by calling the DNS  server. Failed Connections The total number of times  the Virtual Clients tried to connect to the SUT but were unsuccessful, during  the last reporting interval.  This number is always less  than or equal to the number of failed hits because hits can fail for reasons  other than a failed connection. Failed Hits The total number of times the Virtual Clients made an HTTP request but did not receive the correct HTTP response from the SUT during the last reporting interval. Note that each request for each gif, jpeg, html file, etc., is a single hit. Failed Hits Per Second <p>The number of times the Virtual Clients did not obtain the correct HTTP response, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of unsuccessful HTTP requests per second during the last reporting interval.</p> Failed Pages Per Second <p>The number of times the Virtual Clients did not obtain the correct response to an upper level request, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of unsuccessful requests per second during the last reporting interval.</p> Failed Rounds The total number of times the Virtual Clients started but did not complete the script during the last reporting interval. Failed Rounds Per Second The number of times the Virtual Clients started but did not complete an iteration of the script, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds. The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of failed iterations of the script per second during the last reporting interval. First Byte The time it takes a Virtual Client to receive the first byte of data. Gallery See Templates Gallery. Goal\u2013Oriented Test <p>A WebLOAD component enabling you to define the performance goals required, and view the status of your application when it is operating under this performance goal. WebLOAD provides a Goal\u2013Oriented Test Wizard for configuring these performance goals. WebLOAD automatically accelerates the number of Virtual Clients accessing your website until you meet your performance goal.</p><p>Note: The Goal-Oriented Test Wizard was previously called the Cruise Control Wizard.</p> Goal\u2013Oriented Test Wizard See Goal\u2013Oriented Test. Hit Time <p>The time it takes to complete a successful HTTP request, in seconds. Each request for each gif, jpeg, html file, etc., is a single hit. The time of a hit is the sum of the Connect Time, Send Time, Response Time, and Process Time.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the average time it took to make an HTTP request and process its response during the last reporting interval.</p> Hits <p>The total number of times the Virtual Clients made HTTP requests to the System Under Test (SUT) during the last reporting interval.</p><p>For example, a Get statement for a URL retrieves a page. The page can include any number of graphics and contents files. Each request for each gif, jpeg, html file, etc., is a single hit.</p> Hits Per Second <p>The number of times the Virtual Clients made an HTTP request, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds. Each request for each gif, jpeg, html file, etc. is a single hit.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of HTTP requests per second during the last reporting interval.</p> Host A computer connected via a network, participating in a test session. Each Host in a test session has assigned tasks. A host can act as either a Load Machine or a Probing Client Machine. All hosts participating in a test session must be accessible to the Console over a network. Therefore they must run TestTalk, the network agent. HTTP Response Status <p>WebLOAD creates a row in the Statistics Report for each kind of HTTP status code it receives as an HTTP response from the SUT (redirection codes, success codes, server error codes, or client error codes).</p><p>The value posted is the number of times the Virtual Clients received that status code during the last reporting interval.</p> Integrated Report A single configurable report that can integrate both standard performance data, and data from the NT Performance Monitor. This report gives you a more complete picture of the performance of your application. The data to be monitored and the data to be displayed in the report are both configurable in the Console. Internet Productivity Pack (IPP) Provides a set of protocol implementations enabling you to load-test your application using these protocols. Java and ActiveX counters <p>You can add function calls to your scripts that enable you to instantiate and call methods and properties in Java and ActiveX components (see the WebLOAD Scripting Guide). If there are ActiveX or Java function calls in the script that you are running, WebLOAD reports three counters for them in the Statistics Report:</p><p>- The total number of times it occurred</p><p>- The number of times it succeeded</p><p>- The number of times it failed during the last reporting interval.</p><p>The row heading in the Statistics Report is the name of the function call.</p> Java and ActiveX timers <p>You can add function calls to your scripts that enable you to instantiate and call methods and properties in Java and ActiveX components (see the WebLOAD Scripting Guide). If there are ActiveX or Java function calls in the script you are running, WebLOAD reports timers for them in the Statistics Report.</p><p>The timer value is the average amount of time it took to complete the function call, in seconds, during the last reporting interval.</p><p>The row heading in the Statistics Report is the name of the function call.</p> Load Generator The component of the Load Machine that generates Virtual Clients. Load Generators have the task of bombarding the System Under Test with HTTP protocol call requests as defined in the script. WebLOAD assesses the application's performance by measuring the response time experienced by the Virtual Clients. The number of Virtual Clients at any given moment is determined by the user. Load Generator Machine See Load Machine. Load Machine A host that runs Load Generators. Load Generators bombard the application under test with a large load, to enable complete scalability and integrity testing. Load Session <p>A Load Session includes both the complete Load Template and the results obtained while running that Load Session. A Load Template consists of information about the hosts and scripts participating in the current Load Session. The Load Template will also include scheduling information. The complete Load Template is illustrated in the Session Tree. Storing a Load Template saves you time when repeatedly running WebLOAD with the same, or even a similar network configuration, since you don't have to recreate your Load Template from scratch each time you want to start working.</p><p>Storing Load Session results can be useful when you want to examine results from multiple test sessions or for analyzing test session results.</p> Load Size The number of Virtual Clients running during the last reporting interval. Load Template A Load Template contains the complete Load Session definition, without the test results. A Load Template includes information about the participating hosts and the scripts used in the current Load Session. The definition also includes scheduling information and the configuration of the Server Monitor and Integrated Reports. The complete Load Template is illustrated in the Session Tree. Storing a Load Template saves you time when repeatedly running WebLOAD with the same, or even a similar network configuration, since you do not have to recreate your Load Template from scratch each time you rerun a test. Page Time <p>The time it takes to complete a successful upper level request, in seconds. The Page Time is the sum of the Connection Time, Send Time, Response Time, and Process Time for all the hits on a page.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the average time it took the Virtual Clients to make an upper level request and process its response during the last reporting interval.</p> Pages The total number of times the Virtual Client made upper level requests, both successful and unsuccessful, during the last reporting interval. Pages Per Second <p>The number of times the Virtual Clients made upper level requests divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of requests per second during the last reporting interval.</p> Per Time Unit statistics Ratios that calculate an average value for an action or process. For example: Transactions Per Second, Rounds Per Second. Portfolio A Portfolio of reports enables you to generate a single, inclusive report that contains all the charts generated by the templates included in the portfolio. Probing Client A software program which \"bombards\" the SUT as a single Virtual Client, to further measure the performance of the SUT. WebLOAD generates exact values for Probing Client performance. Probing Client Machines Hosts running Probing Client software simulating one Virtual Client, and running at the same time as Load Machines. Probing Client software See Probing Client. Process Time <p>The time it takes WebLOAD to parse an HTTP response from the SUT and then populate the document-object model (DOM), in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the average time it took WebLOAD to parse an HTTP response during the last reporting interval.</p> Receive Time The elapsed time between receiving the first byte and the last byte. Report Portfolio See Portfolio. Resource Manager <p>Distributes and circulates WebLOAD testing resources (Virtual Clients and Probing Clients) amongst users on a \"need to use\" basis. The Resource Manager is packaged with a maximum number of Virtual Clients, Probing Clients and Connected Workstation ports, as defined by the WebLOAD package.</p><p>With the Resource Manager, every WebLOAD Console can operate in Standalone Workstation mode or Connected Workstation mode.</p> Response Data Size <p>The size, in bytes, of all the HTTP responses sent by the SUT during the last reporting interval.</p><p>WebLOAD uses this value to calculate Throughput (bytes per second).</p> Response Time <p>The time it takes the SUT to send the object of an HTTP request back to a Virtual Client, in seconds. In other words, the time from the end of the HTTP request until the Virtual Client has received the complete item it requested.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the average time it took the SUT to respond to an HTTP request during the last reporting interval.</p> Responses <p>The number of times the SUT responded to an HTTP request during the last reporting interval.</p><p>This number should match the number of successful hits.</p> Round Time <p>The time it takes one Virtual Client to finish one complete iteration of a script, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the average time it took the Virtual Clients to finish one complete iteration of the script during the last reporting interval.</p> Rounds The total number of times the Virtual Clients attempted to run the script during the last reporting interval. Rounds Per Second <p>The number of times the Virtual Clients attempted to run the script, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of attempts (both successful and unsuccessful) per second during the last reporting interval.</p> Send Time <p>The time it takes the Virtual Client to write an HTTP request to the SUT, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the average time it took the Virtual Clients to write a request to the SUT during the last reporting interval.</p> Server Performance Measurements <p>If you selected Performance Monitor statistics for the report, WebLOAD creates a row for them and reports their values in the Statistics Report.</p><p>For definitions of the statistics, see the Server Monitor Definition dialog box.</p><p>Be selective when choosing server performance measurements , otherwise the system resources required to manage the data might affect the Console.</p> Session Tree A graphic representation of a Load Template and status. It illustrates the different components of a test session, including Load Machines and Probing Clients, the scripts that they execute, and their status. Single Client See Probing Client. Standard Deviation The average amount the measurement varies from the average since the beginning of the test. Successful Connections <p>The total number of times the Virtual Clients were able to successfully connect to the SUT during the last reporting interval.</p><p>This number is always less than or equal to the number of successful hits because several hits might use the same HTTP connection if the Persistent Connection option is enabled.</p> Successful Hits The total number of times the Virtual Clients made an HTTP request and received the correct HTTP response from the SUT during the last reporting interval. Each request for each gif, jpeg, html file, etc., is a single hit. Successful Hits Per Second <p>The number of times the Virtual Clients obtained the correct HTTP response to their HTTP requests divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of successful HTTP requests per second during the last reporting interval.</p> Successful Pages Per Second The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of successful requests per second during the last reporting interval.

Successful Rounds Per Second <p>The number of times the Virtual Clients completed an entire iteration of the script, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of successful iterations of the script per second during the last reporting interval.</p> SUT The system running the Web application currently under test. The SUT (System Under Test) is accessed by clients through its URL address. The SUT can reside on any machine or on multiple machines, anywhere on the global Internet or your local intranet. Template See Load Template. Templates Gallery The Templates Gallery is a single entity that contains predefined templates, user-defined templates, and portfolios. Test Program See Test Script. Test Script The script. This defines the test scenario used in your Load Session. Scripts are written in JavaScript. Test Template See Load Template. TestTalk The network agent. This program enables communication between the Console and the host computers participating in the test. Throttle Control A WebLOAD component that enables you to dynamically change the Load Size while a test session is in progress. Throughput (Bytes Per Second) The average number of bytes per second transmitted from the SUT to the Virtual Clients running the script during the last reporting interval. In other words, this is the amount of the Response Data Size, divided by the number of seconds in the reporting interval. Time to First Byte The time that elapsed since a request was sent until the Virtual Client received the first byte of data. User-defined Automatic Data Collection <p>If you have Automatic Data Collection enabled, WebLOAD creates three counters for each GET and POST statement in the script:</p><p>- The total number of times the Get and Post statements occurred</p><p>- The number of times the statements succeeded</p><p>- The number of times the statements failed during the last reporting interval.</p> User-defined counters <p>Your own counters that you can add to scripts using the SendCounter() and the SendMeasurement() functions (see the WebLOAD Scripting Guide). If there is a user-defined counter in the script that you are running, WebLOAD reports the counter\u2019s values in the Statistics Report.</p><p>The row heading is the name (argument) of the counter. That is, the row heading is the string in parenthesis in the SendCounter() or SendMeasurement() function call.</p><p>The value reported is the number of times the counter was incremented during the last reporting interval.</p> User-defined timer <p>Timers that you can add to scripts to keep track of the amount of time it takes to complete specific actions (see the WebLOAD Scripting Guide).

You can specify either a form field name or ID. For example, if you specify a form field ID, then the correlation engine will only search for form field IDs and not for form field names. By ID Specify a form field ID to be searched. By Name Specify a form field name to be searched. User defined Search for dynamic data according to your own search criteria. JavaScript expression <p>Specify a JavaScript expression to be used as an extraction logic. This can be a valid regular expression, DOM access function, or any other function call. For example:</p><p>extractValue (\u201cprefix\u201d, \u201csuffix\u201d,</p><p>document.wlSource )</p><p>To call a custom JavaScript function, the function must be accessible for both the execution engine and the correlation engine, so it should be included as an auto-discovered JavaScript code.</p><p>For more information on the auto-discovery of JavaScript files, see JavaScript Language Extension, in the WebLOAD Extensibility SDK.</p> Save Source Select this option if your JavaScript expression refers to the response body (document.wlSource). Replace with expression Expression <p>Replace data according to the Field name, regardless of the value. Replace the value with the value in Expression.</p><p>For example:</p><p>Rule type = Replace with expression</p><p>Expression = new Date().getTime() Field name = timestamp</p><p>During correlation, the timestamp value is replaced with \u201cnewDate().getTime()\u201d instead of the date on which the script was recorded.</p> Search in cookies Cookie name <p>Search for dynamic data among the received cookies, according to the Cookie name.</p><p>Replace the dynamic data in the query string or post data request.</p><p>Note: In most cases, cookies sent by the server (in a Set-Cookie header) are echoed back by the client (in a Cookie header). WebLOAD\u2019s engine automatically handles these cases and they do not require correlation.</p><p>Select this rule type when the value received in the cookie is used elsewhere in the request (using JavaScript) and correlation is necessary.</p> Correlation settings Minimum Length Define the minimum length of the value to be considered for correlation. Shorter values, even if matched by a rule, are ignored. Maximum Length Define the maximum length of the value to be considered for correlation. Longer values, even if matched by a rule, are ignored. Correlate exact matches only <p>Select this option to replace the identified dynamic value with a variable only when the values are a complete match. If the value found is only a part of the sent value, the rule will be ignored.</p><p>For example, if the dynamic value found is \u201c1234\u201dand the variable replacing the dynamic value contains \u201c123\u201d:</p><p>- When Correlate exact matches only is unchecked, the value \u201c1234\u201d will be replaced by the variable and then a \u201c4\u201d.</p><p>- When Correlate exact matches only is checked, the value will not be replaced since it is not an exact match.</p><p> Note: The values within a query string are also considered a complete match. For example, if the dynamic value is found in the following string, wlHttp.Get(http://domain?field=123), the dynamic value \u201c123\u201d will be replaced by the variable regardless of whether the Correlate exact matches only is checked.</p><p>By default this is selected.</p> Field name <p>Replace the dynamic value only when the value is sent with this field name.</p><p>Note: The Field name limits where the value can be replaced and is applicable to all rule types.

This guide describes the recording tools supplied with WebLOAD Recorder for developing test scripts automatically and provides instructions for developing test scripts manually.</p> <p>Before creating a script, you should consider and plan which actions you want to include in a test session.</p> <p>Create a script by carrying out the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>Recording the script.</li> <li>Editing / enhancing the script.</li> <li>Running and debugging the script.</li> </ol> <p>The first step of creating a script is recording. As you execute a typical sequence of activities, WebLOAD Recorder records your accesses, creating a precise, detailed record of all your activities and application responses that occur during a recording session.</p> <p>WebLOAD Recorder operates in conjunction with a Web browser, such as Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer. The basic \u2018Building Blocks\u2019 of a test session are your actions. As you work with a test application in the browser, (navigating between pages, typing text into a form, clicking the mouse, and so on), WebLOAD Recorder stores information about you actions in a script file. Externally, your activities are represented in WebLOAD Recorder by a set of icons arranged in a Visual Script Tree. Internally, WebLOAD Recorder records these actions and automatically creates scripts that act as scripts, recreating the actions and verifying the functionality of Web sites under realistic conditions.</p> <p>The second step of creating a script is editing the code of the recorded script. This can be done in Visual Editing mode and/or JavaScript Editing mode. For example, if you want a script to vary a sequence of accesses, submit randomized data read from a file, or work with Java or COM components, a certain degree of programming is required.

A website is often only the front-end for applications that reside behind the scenes, for back-end components that do the actual work for an application. Testing the components that stand behind your Internet application is essential for comprehensive Internet application testing. A detailed breakdown and analysis of the results of each user activity helps pinpoint the source of any potential bottlenecks or other problems, and expedites the work required for any corrections or improvements.</p> <p>WebLOAD fully supports component based testing.

XML relies on a simple, logical structure that is both easy to learn and works quickly and reliably, focusing on transferring hard data only, with no formatting or presentation information. XML acts as a gateway between autonomous, heterogeneous, component-based systems. This allows users to connect or link to any platform. XML provides an elegant solution for Web masters who wish to reach a wide range of clients, working on any number of diverse systems.</p> <p>WebLOAD provides full support for work with the XML Document Object Model. Using XML DOM objects, WebLOAD scripts are able to both access XML site information, and generate new XML data to send back to the server for processing, taking advantage of all the additional benefits that XML provides.</p> <p>WebLOAD supports:</p> <ul> <li>Working with existing XML Data Islands. Data Islands are XML documents embedded within HTML documents. WebLOAD Recorder, like the IE Browser, produces an XML DOM object for each Data Island.</li> <li>Creating new XML DOM objects via the XML Object Constructor. WebLOAD supports XML Native Browsing through use of the XML Object Constructor.</li> <li>Parsing and manipulating any XML data, using the XML Parser Object.</li> </ul> <p>Both WebLOAD and the IE Browser use the MSXML parser to create XML DOM objects. Since WebLOAD XML DOM objects and Browser XML DOM objects are created by the same MSXML parser, the XML DOM objects that are produced for both WebLOAD and the IE Browser are identical.</p> <p>When working through the IE Browser, XML DOM objects are accessed through the all collection. When working through WebLOAD, XML DOM objects are accessed through the wlXmls collection. Since a WebLOAD XML DOM object is identical to an IE Browser XML DOM object, the WebLOAD XML DOM uses the same Document Interface (programming methods and properties) found in the IE Browser XML DOM.</p> <p>The next few sections of this guide explain basic XML concepts and usage. Look in the WebLOAD JavaScript Reference Guide for a description of the WebLOAD wlXmls collection syntax and for a complete list of the WebLOAD-supported XML DOM Interfaces.</p> <p>For more general XML support and cross platform capabilities, WebLOAD offers the XMLParserObject as another alternative for accessing XML data. The XMLParserObject is based on the open source Xerces XML parser. In addition to the multi-platform support, using this object will result in lower memory consumption and increased performance during load testing.</p> <p>The following sections contain examples using the XMLParserObject.

Java includes a variety of useful features, such as Remote Method Invocation (RMI), which allows local developers to seamlessly access distributed application functions and procedures, and Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), which allows Java clients to interact with any ODBC- or JDBC-compliant database, whether it resides locally or on a remote server. By utilizing Java tools and classes, user applications are able to offer far greater power and capabilities than when working with simple HTML code alone. For this reason, over the past few years, Java has become one of the most popular development mediums for large-scale Internet applications.</p> <p>WebLOAD supports full Java access from your JavaScript scripts. Full Java support means that your WebLOAD scripts will not only test access time to an HTML page. WebLOAD scripts can also invoke and run local Java classes used by the Java applications embedded within an HTML page.

COM technology provides universally reusable binary components. These components can be mixed and matched over versions and years, accessed by applications written in any of a variety of languages, running on any of a variety of platforms, located either locally or over a network. COM automation simplifies application development by maximizing component reusability while increasing the application\u2019s universality. Today, most Windows users rely on COM technology, often without even realizing it. For example, suppose you wish to work with a restricted website. Access to the application behind that website is controlled by a security database. To work with that application, you must first enter your name and password. A COM component will automatically access the database and verify your permission status.</p> <p>COM components are objects that consist of a combination of properties, methods, and interfaces. An object\u2019s interface is simply a set of methods together with a defined set of standards for what those methods do and how they are accessed, their parameters and return values. WebLOAD JavaScript provides direct object access to any component that has a COM wrapping and an IDispatch interface. These are known as ActiveX objects. See ActiveX Object Interfaces (on page 107), for more information.</p> <p>An ActiveX object is viewed and manipulated exactly as any other JavaScript object within the script. WebLOAD encapsulates COM automation functionality, providing an interface between JavaScript scripts and ActiveX objects. For example, a WebLOAD JavaScript script is able to fully test an ASP Web page or a Web page that manipulates an ADO database. In both of these technologies, ActiveX objects are widely used.</p> <p>This section of the guide explains how to work with ActiveX objects within your JavaScript script. For a detailed explanation of COM programming, see the Microsoft MSDN Online Library at http://msdn.microsoft.com (http://msdn.microsoft.com).</p> <p>Note: If you are working with COM objects that are not thread-safe and can not handle multi-threading, you must set the multithreading to one thread per process (this is WebLOAD\u2019s default setting).</p> <p>To set the multithreading:</p> <ol> <li>In the WebLOAD Console, open the Tools &gt; Default/Current Session/script Options dialog box.</li> <li>Select the Browser Parameters tab.</li> <li>In the Multi-thread Virtual Clients-&gt;Load Generator field, enter or scroll to 1, which sets one thread per process.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"scripting/advanced_javascript_features/#activex-object-interfaces","title":"ActiveX Object Interfaces","text":"<p>ActiveX objects usually include the following interfaces:</p> <ul> <li>IUnknown\u2014the core interface.

The fact that JavaScript and COM use slightly different data types is not an issue. WebLOAD simply supports all standard JavaScript and COM data types.</p> <p>WebLOAD JavaScript scripts automatically convert between JavaScript and the corresponding COM data types. The table below illustrates the data type conversions that are supported. The default choices used if no data type information is available are marked in bold in the table.</p> <p>Working with JavaScript and COM data types within a JavaScript script is simple. Passing values from JavaScript scripts as parameters to COM objects can be more complicated. COM does not expect, nor does COM know how to convert from, a JavaScript data type. WebLOAD is responsible for smoothing the interface between JavaScript and COM, converting between JavaScript and the corresponding COM data types when necessary.</p> <p>When the data type is known, WebLOAD automatically converts between JavaScript data types and the corresponding COM data type. If the data type is unknown, WebLOAD checks to see if a TypeInfo library is available for the object. (TypeInfo is usually available.) When available, WebLOAD takes the data type information from the TypeInfo library and completes the conversion as usual.</p> <p>If TypeInfo information is not accessible, WebLOAD uses a basic common-sense heuristic to determine the data type and select the appropriate conversion, based on the preceding default conversion table. For example, if a variable A has been assigned a value of 5, WebLOAD assumes that the variable should be of type Integer.</p> <p>However, relying on sensible assumptions may inadvertently lead to complications. For example, the user may actually intend to pass that variable A as a parameter to a method that expects a String \u201c5\u201d. Or you may be working with an array containing a whole set of variables of unknown data types, a more complicated situation. For these reasons, WebLOAD recommends using casting functions when the data type is unknown, to ensure that the variables are converted to the correct data type before being passed as parameters to an ActiveX object method. The WebLOAD casting functions are described in the following section, *Using Casting Functions for JavaScript and COM Data Types* (on page 113).</p> JavaScript Data Type \u00ae Integer Double Boolean String Date ActiveX Object Array COM Data Type Byte Yes Yes Yes - - - - Short Yes Yes Yes - - - - Long Yes Yes Yes - - - - Float Yes Yes Yes - - - - Double Yes Yes Yes - - - - <p>VARIANT_</p><p>BOOL</p> Yes Yes Yes - - - - Date - - - - Yes - - BSTR Yes Yes Yes Yes - - - IUnknown - - - - - Yes - IDispatch - - - - - Yes - SAFEARRAY - - - - - - Yes"},{"location":"scripting/advanced_javascript_features/#using-casting-functions-for-javascript-and-com-data-types","title":"Using Casting Functions for JavaScript and COM Data Types","text":"<p>WebLOAD recommends using casting functions under the following circumstances:</p> <ul> <li>When no TypeInfo library is available.</li> <li>When you know you are passing mismatched data types.</li> <li>If you receive a TypeError message from COM.</li> </ul> <p>Casting functions ensure that JavaScript variables are converted to the correct data type before being passed as parameters to an ActiveX object method. To explain why casting functions are recommended, this section focuses on how JavaScript and COM work with arrays.</p> <p>Arrays are collections or sets of variables. The values stored within a JavaScript array may either all be of the same data type, (i.e., all integers or all strings), or they may consist of a variety of different data types. COM includes a SafeArray option, asserting that all the items within the array are of the same type. For maximum flexibility, SafeArrays also provide the option of all items being of type Variant.</p> <p>While each item is officially of the \u2018same type\u2019, this actually means that each item may be of any Variant\u2013 compatible data type.</p> <p>While there are very few restrictions on the kinds of data types acceptable by ActiveX objects for array parameters, the one requirement is that whatever is passed must be of the correct (expected) data type. If an ActiveX object method expects to receive an array of type Integer, it must be passed an array of type Integer and not an array of type Variant, even if all the array elements do happen to be integers. When passing a JavaScript array object as a parameter to an ActiveX object method, the items of that array must be converted correctly to the corresponding ActiveX object data types or the method will fail.</p> <p>If nothing is known about the data type of an array\u2019s elements, WebLOAD tries to choose the most logical data type for that array. For example, if all the values in the array appear to be of the same data type, WebLOAD will pass an array of that data type. If the values in the array appear to be of different data types, WebLOAD will pass an array of type Variant. While this approach will almost always work, it may occasionally fail. For example, in the rare event that an array of type Variant coincidentally contains only items that happen to all be of the same Integer data type, WebLOAD will analyze the elements of that array, conclude that it must be of type Integer, and convert it accordingly to an ActiveX array object of type Integer. This may be a logical decision, but the method will fail.</p> <p>To avoid this small possibility of failure during your testing session, WebLOAD provides a complete set of casting functions. While casting functions may be used at any time, explicitly setting a data type is usually recommended only when no TypeInfo library is available, when you know you are passing mismatched data types, or if you receive a TypeError message from COM. (COM errors, which appear as standard error messages on the WebLOAD Console, are usually triggered by an error in the application being tested, for example, by an error in the ActiveX object\u2019s TypeInfo library.)</p> <p>WebLOAD provides the following casting functions:</p> <ul> <li>CByte()</li> <li>CInt()</li> <li>CLng()</li> <li>CDbl()</li> <li>CFlt()</li> <li>CBool()</li> <li>CVARIANT()</li> </ul> <p>These functions take a variable as a parameter and return that value cast to the specified data type. Only legal data type conversions, as listed the table in *Automatic Conversion between JavaScript and COM Data Types* (on page 112), are allowed.</p> <p>For example, assume you had an array that should be passed as data type Variant, but it only holds items with integer values. To prevent problems, use the CVARIANT() function to explicitly cast the array elements to the Variant data type, as follows:</p> <p><code>My\\_variant\\_arr = new Array()</code> </p> <p><code>My\\_variant\\_arr[0] = CVARIANT(1)</code> </p> <p><code>My\\_variant\\_arr[1] = CVARIANT(21)</code> </p> <p><code>My\\_variant\\_arr[2] = CVARIANT(32)</code> </p> <p><code>My\\_variant\\_arr[4] = CVARIANT(44)</code></p> <p><code>Result = RemoteCOMobject.Add(My\\_variant\\_arr)</code></p> <p>Remember, if your array contains elements with a variety of data types, you don\u2019t have to explicitly cast the array elements to force the array to be converted to data type Variant. WebLOAD will understand that this is a Variant array based on the variety of data types found. However, you may always use a casting function if you wish:</p> <p><code>My\\_variant\\_arr = new Array()</code> </p> <p><code>My\\_variant\\_arr[0] = CVARIANT(1)</code> </p> <p><code>My\\_variant\\_arr[1] = CVARIANT(21.1)</code> </p> <p><code>My\\_variant\\_arr[2] = CVARIANT(\"John\")</code></p> <p><code>My\\_variant\\_arr[4] = CVARIANT(new Date(1999,1,1))</code> </p> <p><code>Result = RemoteCOMobject.Concat(My\\_variant\\_arr)</code></p> <p>In another example, assume you had an array that should be passed as data type</p> <p><code>Double</code>. The elements were assigned a variety of Integer and Double data type values. There is no TypeInfo library available. WebLOAD, seeing a combination of integer and double values, will assume that this is an array of data type Variant.</p> <p>However, the method is expecting an array of data type Double. To prevent problems, use the CDbl() function to explicitly cast the integer array elements to the Double data type, as follows:</p> <p><code>My\\_double\\_arr = new Array()</code> </p> <p><code>My\\_double\\_arr[0] = 100.1</code> </p> <p><code>My\\_double\\_arr[1] = CDbl(21)</code> </p> <p><code>My\\_double\\_arr[2] = 22.2</code></p> <p><code>Result = RemoteCOMobject.AddDoubles(My\\_double\\_arr)</code></p>"},{"location":"scripting/advanced_javascript_features/#dcom-over-http","title":"DCOM over HTTP","text":"<p>In today\u2019s work environment, applications are often distributed over a network.

On the JavaScript side, you can use a wrapper object to access methods and fields of the Java object; calling a method or accessing a property on the wrapper results in a call on the Java object. On the Java side, JavaScript objects are wrapped in an instance of the class netscape.javascript.JSObject and passed to Java.</p> <p>When a JavaScript object is sent to Java, the runtime engine creates a Java wrapper of type JSObject. When a JSObject is sent from Java to JavaScript, the runtime engine unwraps the JSObject revealing the original JavaScript object type. The JSObject class provides an interface for invoking JavaScript methods and examining JavaScript properties.</p>"},{"location":"scripting/appendix_b/#javascript-to-java-communication","title":"JavaScript to Java Communication","text":"<p>When you refer to a Java package or class, or work with a Java object or array, you use one of the special LiveConnect objects.

JavaClass A JavaScript reference to a Java class. JavaObject A wrapped Java object, accessed from within JavaScript code. JavaPackage A JavaScript reference to a Java package. <p>Note: Because Java is a strongly typed language and JavaScript is weakly typed, the JavaScript runtime engine converts argument values into the appropriate data types for the other language when you use LiveConnect. See Data Type Conversions (on page 185), for more information.</p> <p>In some ways, the existence of the LiveConnect objects is transparent, because you interact with Java in a fairly intuitive way. For example, you can create a Java String object and assign it to the JavaScript variable myString by using the new operator with the Java constructor, as follows:</p> <p><code>var myString = new java.lang.String(\"Hello world\")</code></p> <p>In the previous example, the variable myString is a JavaObject because it holds an instance of the Java object String. As a JavaObject, myString has access to the public instance methods of java.lang.String and its superclass, java.lang.Object.

Beginning users may take advantage of the basic WebLOAD Recorder tool set without ever understanding exactly how these features are implemented.

You don\u2019t have to be familiar with the JavaScript language to work with</p> <p>WebLOAD and WebLOAD Recorder, and test applications. JavaScript scripts are recorded through WebLOAD Recorder. As you execute a typical sequence of activities, WebLOAD Recorder records the HTTP protocol level traffic that is generated by the Web browser according to your accesses. By the conclusion of your recording session, a complete JavaScript script file is created.</p> <p>The basic \u2018Building Blocks\u2019 of a recording session are HTTP requests, which are triggered by user actions. Each time a user navigates to a new URL or submits a form, the browser emits an HTTP method and the resulting HTTP request is recorded.</p> <p>Externally, user activities (at the protocol level) are represented on the WebLOAD Recorder desktop by a set of clear, intuitive icons and visual devices arranged in a visual Script Tree. Internally, WebLOAD Recorder automatically creates JavaScript scripts that act as scripts, recreating the HTTP traffic created by the actions of the original user during later test sessions.</p> <p>Most users begin application testing by simply recording and then running a series of basic scripts, without ever looking into a script\u2019s internal Building Blocks to see the actual JavaScript code inside. As their understanding of the WebLOAD Recorder tool set grows, many users decide to expand or tailor their original set of scripts to meet a particular testing need, adding customized features that sometimes require some editing of the JavaScript code within the script itself. WebLOAD Recorder offers a wide range of features and options, for users who wish to add more functionality to their scripts, rather than simply replaying the same set of HTTP methods exactly as originally recorded. Many of these tools are available through the WebLOAD Recorder GUI and do not require any additional programming skills. These tools are documented in the WebLOAD Recorder User Guide. The more complex tools that require some familiarity with JavaScript programming are described in the remaining chapters of this guide, with detailed syntax specifications provided in the WebLOAD JavaScript Reference Guide.</p> <p>Test session scripts are written in JavaScript. JavaScript is an object-oriented scripting language originally developed by Netscape Communications Corporation and is currently maintained by the Mozilla Foundation. JavaScript is best known for its use in conjunction with HTML to automate World Wide Web pages. However, JavaScript is actually a full-featured programming language that can be used for many purposes besides Web automation. WebLOAD and WebLOAD Recorder have chosen JavaScript as the scripting language for test session scripts. WebLOAD Recorder JavaScript scripts combine the ease and simplicity of WebLOAD\u2019s visual, intuitive programming environment with the flexibility and power of JavaScript object-oriented programming.</p>"},{"location":"scripting/programming_your_javascript/#script-tree-structure","title":"Script Tree Structure","text":""},{"location":"scripting/programming_your_javascript/#script-tree-nodes","title":"Script Tree Nodes","text":"<p>JavaScript scripts are represented on the WebLOAD Recorder desktop by a script Tree.

Each node in the Script Tree represents a single user action at the HTTP protocol level, such as submitting a form or navigating to a new URL. Script Tree nodes provide an intuitive, graphic representation of the underlying JavaScript code that actually implements the user activities to be recreated at run time.</p> <p>The following figure illustrates a typical Script Tree fragment:</p> <p></p> <p>Script Tree nodes are arranged sequentially. The sequential arrangement of icons in the Script Tree means that icons appear in the Script Tree in the order in which the user actions and HTTP methods occurred when originally recorded. URL nodes in a script Tree will appear in the order in which the browser requested each Web page over the course of a recording session. In cases where the browser emits asynchronous requests (for example, while using AJAX), the requests are recorded and appear in the Script Tree in the order that the browser emitted them.</p> <p>Note: WebLOAD Recorder offers users a wide range of tools and features that can add very powerful functionality to a testing script. While users are certainly encouraged to incorporate these tools in their Script Tree, users must also be careful when editing URL nodes in the Script Tree.

The testing tool, your script, must consume minimal system resources to have as small an impact as possible on the performance of the application being tested. To minimize system overhead when running your test script, WebLOAD recommends using the minimal level of global sharing required to run your test correctly.</p> <p>Variables that are accessible within a single script only have the smallest impact on system performance, as noted in wlGeneratorGlobal Example (on page 52). For maximum efficiency and simplicity, WebLOAD strongly recommends creating and managing user-defined variables through the WebLOAD Recorder GUI, as described in the WebLOAD Recorder User Guide.</p> <p>Values shared between multiple scripts, but within a single Load Generator, are the next most efficient choice. Global values shared system wide should only be included in your script if it is truly necessary to check values or synchronize data shared across multiple Load Generators or machines.</p> <p>To optimize performance times during a test, multiple access requests from multiple sources are accommodated sequentially. Script execution is not held for the Set() or Add() methods, which are queued and processed sequentially. Only the Get() method actually holds a script while waiting for the requested value to be returned.</p> <p>Over the course of a typical test session, multiple script threads may all be accessing, and potentially changing, the values of the same global variables. For example, two threads may each get GlobalVarX, currently set to 10. The two threads may then wish to increment GlobalVarX by 1, setting it to a new value of 11. These two Get() and two Set() commands are processed sequentially, independent of each other. Since each script got an initial value of 10, each script will independently set the value to 11. The final value will be set to 11, even though the variable was actually incremented twice, and should now equal 12. To avoid this potential inconsistency, WebLOAD recommends using the Add() command, which gets, changes, and resets a global value in a single action, ensuring /that each thread always accesses the most current value for a global variable and avoiding potential conflicts between threads.</p>"},{"location":"scripting/programming_your_javascript/#identification-variables-and-functions","title":"Identification Variables and Functions","text":"<p>For performance statistics to be meaningful, testers must be able to identify the exact point being measured.

These activities may be required by an HTTP server.  &gt; **Note:** You may use the methods of wlCookie to create as many cookies as needed. For example, each WebLOAD client running a script can set its own cookie identified by a unique name.  wlCookie is a local object. WebLOAD automatically creates an independent wlCookie object for each thread of a script. You cannot manually declare wlCookie objects yourself. See the *WebLOAD JavaScript Reference Guide* for a complete syntax specification for the wlCookie object and its methods.  ### How WebLOAD Works with Cookies WebLOAD always accepts cookies that are sent from a server. When WebLOAD connects to a server, it automatically submits any cookies in the server\u2019s domain that it has stored. By default, WebLOAD clears the cookie cache after every round.  The wlCookie object lets you supplement or override this behavior in the following ways:  - A thread can create its own cookies. - A thread can delete cookies that it created.  Except for the above, WebLOAD does not distinguish in any way between cookies that it receives from a server and those that you create yourself. For example, if a thread creates a cookie in a particular domain, it automatically submits the cookie when it connects to any server in the domain.    ### wlCookie Methods The wlCookie object works with the following methods:  - `ClearAll()`\u2014Delete all cookies set by wlCookie in the current thread. - `Delete()`\u2014Delete the cookie identified by the method parameters. The cookie must have been previously created by wlCookie. - `Get()`\u2014Returns the cookie value. If there is more than one cookie with the same parameters it returns the first cookie. - `Set()`\u2014Creates a cookie. You can set an arbitrary number of cookies in any thread. If you set more than one cookie applying to a particular domain, WebLOAD submits them all when it connects to the domain.  &gt; **Note:** Set cookies within the main script of the script. WebLOAD deletes all the cookies at the end of each round. If you wish to delete cookies in the middle of a round, use the Delete() or ClearAll() method.  ### Example: using a cookie Cookies are used by applications to store the application requests on the client side. This enables the client to perform a one-time application request and from then on the request information is retrieved from the client\u2019s cookies.   <pre><code>//Request information entered into the application wlHttp.ContentType = \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" wlHttp.FormData[\"username\"] = \"zadp10\" wlHttp.FormData[\"password\"] = \"Start100\" wlHttp.FormData[\"submit1\"] = \"Login\"\n\n//Setting the cookie\n\nwlCookie.Set(\u201cUserID\u201d, \u201czapd10\u201d, \u201c[www.abcdef.net](http://www.abcdef.net/),\u201d, \u201c/\u201d, \u201cSun, 19- Jun-2011 17:29:00 GMT\u201d)\n\n//WebLOAD submits the cookie [wlHttp.Post(\"https://www.abcdef.net/default.aspx\")](http://www.abcdef.net/default.aspx)\n\n//Getting the cookie\n\nCookieValue = wlCookie.Get(\"UserID\")\n\n//The value returned in CookieValue is \u201czapd10\u201d\n\n\nIn some cases it is also necessary to delete the cookie settings. You can do this by entering:\n\n\n\n//Delete the cookie wlCookie.ClearAll()\n\n\n</code></pre>    ## Handling Binary Data  WebLOAD supports the simulation of binary data sent from the browser to the server. Binary data is handled specially, since it cannot be displayed as JavaScript literals in the script, unlike other types of data that can be displayed, such as numbers or text.  ### Recording Binary Data WebLOAD supports recording binary data in a script in one of the following ways:  - Recording binary data as a data file, which is external to the script. - Encoding binary data in the script, so that you can view and edit the data.  #### Recording Binary Data as a Data File  Modifying the script Options settings in the WebLOAD Recorder enables writing binary data into a data file, which is stored locally. When working with data files, only the name of the file is stored in the script itself.  Recording binary data as a data file, enables WebLOAD to simulate sending binary data to the application, although the data itself cannot be edited in the script.  **To record binary data as a data file:**  1. In WebLOAD Recorder, select **Tools Recording and Script Generation Options**. The Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box appears.  1. In the Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box select the **Post Data**tab.      The Post Data tab appears.      ![Recording and Script Generation Options \u2013 Post Data Tab](../images/script_guide_110.png)    1. In the Add New Type field, enter the binary content-type, such as application/x-amf, which is used for binary content generated by a Flash application.  1. Click **As DATAFILE**.     The binary content-type is added to the DATAFILE block list.  1. In the Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box, select the **Content Types** tab.     The Content Types tab appears.     ![Recording and Script Generation Options \u2013 Content Types Tab](../images/script_guide_111.png)    1. Ensure that the appropriate binary content-type appears in the Recorded Types area. If the content does not appear, add the binary content type in the Add new content type field and click **Add**.  After setting the Record Option settings, binary data is stored in a local data file and the name of the file appears in the script.  The following sample script demonstrates how WebLOAD records binary data as a data file:   <pre><code>function InitAgenda()\n\n{\n\nCopyFile(\"wl2288601006.dat\",\"wl2288601006.dat\")\n\n}\n\nwlGlobals.GetFrames = false wlHttp.Get([\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html\"](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html))\n\nSleep(9056)\n\n\n\nwlHttp.Header[\"Referer\"] = [\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Shop.swf\"](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Shop.swf)\n\nwlHttp.Header[\"Content-type\"] = \"application/x-amf\" wlHttp.Header[\"Content-length\"] = \"58\" wlHttp.DataFile[\"Type\"] = \"application/x-amf\" wlHttp.DataFile[\"Filename\"] = \"wl2288601006.dat\"\n\nwlHttp.Post([\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flashservices/gateway](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flashservices/gateway)\n\n.php\")\n</code></pre>     #### Encoding Binary Data in the script  Modifying the script Options settings in the WebLOAD Recorder enables the encoding of binary data in the script during the recording. Once recorded, the script can be edited, parameterized, and load tested as a regular script.  **To enable encoding binary data in the script:**  1. In WebLOAD Recorder, select the **Tools** \u0086 **Recording and Script Generation Options** dialog box.     The Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box appears.  1. In the Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box select the **Script Generation** tab.     The Script Generation tab appears.     ![Recording and Script Generation Options - Script Generation Tab](../images/script_guide_112.png)  1. Select the **Encode binary data** checkbox.     This enables the user to view and parameterize the binary content.  1. In the Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box, select the **Post Data** tab.     The Post Data tab appears.     ![Recording and Script Generation Options \u2013 Post Data Tab](../images/script_guide_113.png)  1. In the Add New Type field, enter the binary content-type, such as application/x-amf, which is used for binary text generated by a Flash application.  1. Click **As DATA**. The binary content-type is added to the DATA block list.  1. In the Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box, select the **Content Types** tab.     The Content Types tab appears (see [Figure 29](#_bookmark135)).  1. Ensure that the appropriate binary content-type appears in the Recorded Types area. If the content does not appear, add the binary content type in the Add new content type field and click **Add**.     After setting the Record Option settings, when binary data is recorded and encoded in a script, wlHttp.EncodeRequestBinaryData = true is automatically added to the script. This encodes the binary data into the following usable format:    `wlHttp.Data[\"Value\"] = \"%00%00%00%00%00%01%00/com.oreilly.frdg.SearchProducts.getSearch Result%00%02/1%00%00%00%18%0a%00%00%00%01%03%00%06search%02%00%0 4wood%00%00%09\"`  The following sample script demonstrates how WebLOAD handles binary data encoded in the script:   <pre><code>function InitAgenda()\n\n{\n\nIncludeFile(\"wlamf.js\",WLExecuteScript);\n\n}\n\nwlGlobals.GetFrames = false wlHttp.EncodeRequestBinaryData = true\n\nwlGlobals.UserAgent = \"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)\"\n\nwlHttp.Get([\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html\"](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html))\n\nwlHttp.EncodeRequestBinaryData = true\n\nwlHttp.Header[\"Referer\"] = [\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html\"](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html)\n\nwlHttp.Get([\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/history.ht](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/history.htm)m\")\n\nwlHttp.EncodeRequestBinaryData = true\n\nwlHttp.Header[\"Referer\"] = [\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/history.htm\"](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/history.htm)\n\nwlHttp.Get([\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/history.swf\"](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/history.swf))\n\nwlHttp.EncodeRequestBinaryData = true\n\nwlHttp.Header[\"Referer\"] = [\"h](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html)[ttp://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html\"](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html)\n\nwlHttp.Get([\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Shop.swf](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Shop.swf)\")\n\nwlHttp.EncodeRequestBinaryData = true\n\nwlHttp.Header[\"Referer\"] = [\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Shop.swf\"](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Shop.swf)\n\nwlHttp.Data[\"Type\"] = \"application/x-amf\" wlHttp.Data[\"Value\"] =\n\n\"%00%03%00%00%00%01%00%15talkback.returnString%00%02/1%00%00%00% 15%0a%00%00%00%02%02%00%06George%02%00%04Bush\"\n\nwlHttp.Post[(\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flashservices/gateway](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flashservices/gateway)\n\n.php\")\n</code></pre>     ## Handling Authentication in the Script  WebLOAD supports working with scripts containing Basic, NTLM, and Kerberos user authentication methods.  WebLOAD handles authentication in playback in the following way:  1. WebLOAD sends a regular request with no request for authentication, to which the server responds with an \u201cunauthorized\u201d error (401), and a prompt to enter a username and password. 1. If WebLOAD is using:     - **Basic authentication**, WebLOAD encrypts the username and password in        wlHttp.Username and wlHttp.Password, and makes a request.     - **NTLM authentication**, WebLOAD sets the following:        wlGlobals.AuthType = \"NTLM\", where NTLM is the default value if no authentication type is specified.     - **Kerberos authentication**, WebLOAD sets the following:        wlGlobals.AuthType = \"Kerberos\".        wlGlobals.KDCServer = . If no value is specified for KDCServer, the authentication type is automatically assumed to be NTLM, even if the AuthType is Kerberos.  The following examples demonstrate the authentication processes in WebLOAD.  **Kerberos authentication:**  `wlGlobals.AuthType = \"Kerberos\"`   `wlGlobals.KDCServer = \"mulier.qalab.internal\"`   `wlHttp.NTPassWord = \"Buga859\"`   `wlHttp.NTUserName = \"qalab.internal\\\\test\"`   `wlHttp.Get(\"\")`     **NTLM authentication:**  `wlGlobals.AuthType = \"NTLM\"`   `wlHttp.NTPassWord = \"Buga859\"`   `wlHttp.NTUserName = \"qalab.internal\\\\test\"`   `wlHttp.Get(\"\")`  OR  `wlHttp.NTPassWord = \"Buga859\"`   `wlHttp.NTUserName = \"qalab.internal\\\\test\"`   `wlHttp.Get(\"\")`    **Basic authentication:**  `wlHttp.PassWord = \"Buga859\"`   `wlHttp.UserName = \"test\"`  `wlHttp.Get(\"\")`"}]}
