(Replaced by WebLOAD Recorder.) Aborted  Rounds The  number of times the Virtual Clients started to run a script but did not  complete the script, during the last reporting interval. This might be due to  session being stopped either automatically or manually by the user. script Specification  of the sequence of HTTP protocol calls sent by Virtual Clients to the SUT  (System Under Test).  Scripts  are written in JavaScript. You can either write scripts as a text file or  generate them automatically using the WebLOAD Recorder. Application  Being Tested (ABT) See SUT. Attempted  Connections The  total number of times the Virtual Clients attempted to connect to the SUT  during the last reporting interval. Automatic  Transaction counters If you have Automatic  Transactions enabled, WebLOAD  creates three counters for each GET and POST statement in the script:  \u009f The total number of times it occurred  \u009f The number of times it succeeded  \u009f The number of times it failed during the last reporting interval Average For  timers, average is the total amount of time counted by the timer (not the  elapsed time) divided by the Count (that is, the total number of readings).  For example, the average for Transaction Time is the amount of time it took  to complete all the successful transactions divided by the number of  successful transactions (the Count). Built-in  Timer A timer  measures the time required to perform a given task. WebLOAD supports both  programmed timers and built-in timers. ROUND TIME is a built-in timer. The  ROUND TIME is the time needed for one complete execution of a script. Connect  Time The time  it takes for a Virtual Client to connect to the System Under Test (the SUT),  in seconds. In other words, the time it takes from the beginning of the HTTP  request to the TCP/IP connection.  The value posted in the Current  Value column is the average time it took a Virtual Client to connect to the  SUT during the last reporting interval.  If the  Persistent Connection option is enabled, there may not be a value for Connect  Time because the HTTP connection remains open between successive HTTP  requests. Connection  Speed (Bits Per Second) The  number of bits transmitted back and forth between the Virtual Clients and the  System Under Test (SUT) divided by the time it took to transmit those bits,  in seconds.  You can  set the Virtual Clients to emulate a particular connection speed during the  test, either by using the Variable Connection Speed settings, or by coding  the connection speed in the script.  If a  connection speed is specified for the test, WebLOAD reports it in the  Statistics Report.  The  value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of bits passed  per second during the last reporting interval. It should match, very closely,  the connection speed you specified for the test. Console The WebLOAD component that manages  the test session. The Console performs the following:  \u009f Configures Load Session hosts and scripts  \u009f Schedules Load Session scripts  \u009f Configures Goal\u2013Oriented test sessions  \u009f Monitors the application's performance  under the generated load  \u009f Manages the Load Session as it is  running, allowing you to pause, stop, and continue Load Session components as needed  \u009f Displays the current performance of the SUT  \u009f Provides a final performance reports for Probing Clients and Virtual Clients  Manages exporting of performance reports Count (For timers only.) The total number of readings (the number  of times the item being timed has occurred) for the timed statistic since the  beginning of the test. For example, for Transaction Time, Count shows the  number of transactions that have been completed. Current  Slice The value posted for this reporting interval in the  Statistics Report main window. Current  Slice Average For per  time unit statistics and counters, average is the total of all of the current  values for the last reporting interval, divided by the number of readings.  For timers, average is the total amount of time counted by  the timer (not the elapsed time) divided by the Count (that is, the total  number of readings for the last reporting interval). For example, the average  for Transaction Time is the amount of time it took to complete all the  successful transactions in the last reporting interval, divided by the number  of successful transactions (the Current Slice Count). Current  Slice Count (For  timers only.) The total number of readings (the number of times the item  being timed has occurred) for the timed statistic for the last reporting  interval. For example, for Transaction Time, Current Slice Count shows the  number of transactions that have been completed over the last reporting  interval. Current  Slice Max The  highest value reported for this statistic over the last reporting interval. Current  Slice Min The  lowest value reported for this statistic over the last reporting interval. Current  Slice Standard Deviation The  average amount the measurement for this statistic varies from the average  over the last reporting interval. Current  Slice Sum The  aggregate or total value for this statistic in this script over the last  reporting interval. DNS  Lookup Time The time  it takes to resolve the host name and convert it to an IP address by calling  the DNS server. Failed  Connections The total number of times the  Virtual Clients tried to connect to the SUT but were unsuccessful, during the  last reporting interval.  This  number is always less than or equal to the number of failed hits because hits  can fail for reasons other than a failed connection. Failed  Hits The total number of times the  Virtual Clients made an HTTP request but did not receive the correct HTTP response  from the SUT during the last reporting interval. Note that each request for  each gif, jpeg, html file, etc., is a single hit. Failed  Hits Per Second The  number of times the Virtual Clients did not obtain the correct HTTP response  divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.  The value posted in the Current  Value column is the number (sum) of unsuccessful HTTP requests per second  during the last reporting interval. Failed  Pages Per Second The  number of times the Virtual Clients did not obtain the correct response to an  upper level request, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.  The  value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of unsuccessful  requests per second during the last reporting interval. Failed  Rounds The  total number of times the Virtual Clients started but did not complete the  script during the last reporting interval. Failed  Rounds Per Second The  number of times the Virtual Clients started but did not complete an iteration  of the script, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds. The value posted in  the Current Value column is the number (sum) of failed iterations of the  script per second during the last reporting interval. First  Byte The time  it takes a Virtual Client to receive the first byte of data. Gallery See Templates Gallery. Goal\u2013Oriented  Test A  WebLOAD component enabling you to define the performance goals required, and  view the status of your application when it is operating under this  performance goal. WebLOAD provides a Goal\u2013Oriented Test Wizard for  configuring these performance goals. WebLOAD automatically accelerates the  number of Virtual Clients accessing your website until you meet your  performance goal.  Note:  The Goal-Oriented Test Wizard was  previously called the Cruise Control Wizard. Goal\u2013Oriented  Test Wizard See Goal\u2013Oriented   Test. Hit  Time The time  it takes to complete a successful HTTP request, in seconds. Each request for  each gif, jpeg, html file, etc., is a single hit. The time of a hit is  the sum of the Connect Time, Send Time, Response Time, and Process Time.  The value posted in the Current  Value column is the average time it took to make an HTTP request and process  its response during the last reporting interval. Hits The total number of times the  Virtual Clients made HTTP  requests to the System Under Test (SUT) during the last reporting interval.  For  example, a Get statement for a URL retrieves a page. The page can include any  number of graphics and contents files. Each request for each gif, jpeg, html file,  etc., is a single hit. Hits  Per Second The number of times the Virtual  Clients made an HTTP request divided by the elapsed time, in seconds. Each  request for each gif, jpeg, html file,  etc., is a single hit.  The value posted in the Current  Value column is the number (sum) of HTTP requests per second during the last  reporting interval. Host A computer connected via a  network, participating in a test session. Each Host in a test session has  assigned tasks. A host can act as either a Load Machine or a Probing Client  Machine. All hosts participating in a test session must be accessible to the  Console over a network. Therefore they must run TestTalk, the network agent. HTTP  Response Status WebLOAD  creates a row in the Statistics Report for each kind of HTTP status code it  receives as an HTTP response from the SUT (redirection codes, success codes,  server error codes, or client error codes).  The value posted is the number  of times the Virtual Clients received that status code during the last  reporting interval. Integrated  Reports A single configurable report  that can integrate both standard performance data, and data from the NT  Performance Monitor. This report gives you a more complete picture of the  performance of your application. The data to be monitored and the data to be  displayed in the report are both configurable in the Console. Internet  Productivity Pack (IPP) Provides a set of protocol  implementations enabling you to load-test your application using these  protocols. Java  and ActiveX counters You can  add function calls to your scripts that enable you to instantiate and call  methods and properties in Java and ActiveX components (see the WebLOAD  Scripting Guide). If there are ActiveX or Java function calls in the  script that you are running, WebLOAD reports three counters for them in the  Statistics Report:  \u009f The total number of times it occurred  \u009f The number of times it succeeded  \u009f The number of times it failed during the last reporting interval  The row heading in the  Statistics Report is the name of the function call. Java  and ActiveX timers You  can add function calls to your scripts that enable you to instantiate and  call methods and properties in Java and ActiveX components (see the WebLOAD  Scripting Guide). If there are ActiveX or Java function calls in the  script you are running, WebLOAD reports timers for them in the Statistics Report.  The  timer value is the average amount of time it took to complete the function  call, in seconds, during the last reporting interval.  The row  heading in the Statistics Report is the name of the function call. Load  Generator The  component of the Load Machine that generates Virtual Clients. Load Generators  have the task of bombarding the System Under Test with HTTP protocol call  requests as defined in the script. WebLOAD assesses the application's  performance by measuring the response  time experienced by the Virtual Clients. The number of Virtual Clients at any  given moment is determined by the user. Load  Generator Machine See  Load Machine. Load  Machine A  host that runs Load Generators. Load Generators bombard the application under  test with a large load, to enable complete scalability and integrity testing. Load  Session A Load  Session includes both the complete Load Template and the results obtained  while running that Load Session. A Load Template consists of information  about the hosts and scripts participating in the current Load Session. The  Load Template will also include scheduling information. The complete Load  Template is illustrated in the Session Tree. Storing a Load Template saves  you time when repeatedly running WebLOAD with the same, or even a similar  network configuration, since you don't have to recreate your Load Template  from scratch each time you want to start working.  Storing  Load Session results can be useful when you want to examine results from  multiple test sessions or for analyzing test session results. Load  Size The  number of Virtual Clients running during the last reporting interval. Load  Template A Load  Template contains the complete Load Session definition, without the test  results. A Load Template includes information about the participating hosts  and the scripts used in the current Load Session. The definition also  includes scheduling information and the configuration of the Server Monitor  and Integrated Reports. The complete Load Template is illustrated in the  Session Tree. Storing a Load Template saves you time when repeatedly running  WebLOAD with the same, or even a similar network configuration, since you do  not have to recreate your Load Template from scratch each time you rerun a  test. Page  Time The time  it takes to complete a successful upper level request, in seconds. The Page  Time is the sum of the Connect Time, Send Time, Response Time, and Process  Time for all the hits on a page.  The  value posted in the Current Value column is the average time it took the  Virtual Clients to make an upper level request and process its response  during the last reporting interval. Pages The  total number of times the Virtual Client made upper level requests, both successful  and unsuccessful, during the last reporting interval. Pages  Per Second The number of times the Virtual  Clients made upper level requests divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.  The  value posted in the Current Value column is  the number (sum) of requests per second during the last reporting interval. Per  Time Unit statistics Ratios that calculate an average  value for an action or process. For example: Transactions Per Second, Rounds  Per Second. Portfolio A Portfolio enables you to  generate a single, inclusive report that contains all the charts generated by  the templates included in the portfolio. Probing  Client A software program which  \"bombards\" the SUT as a single Virtual Client, to further measure  the performance of the SUT. WebLOAD generates exact values for Probing Client  performance. Probing  Client Machine Hosts running Probing Client  software simulating one Virtual Client, and run at the same time as Load  Machines. Probing  Client software See Probing   Client. Process  Time The time it takes WebLOAD to  parse an HTTP response from the SUT and then populate the document-object  model (DOM), in seconds.  The value posted in the Current  Value column is the average time it took WebLOAD to parse an HTTP response  during the last reporting interval. Receive  Time The elapsed time between  receiving the first byte and the last byte. Report  Portfolio See Portfolio. Resource  Manager Distributes  and circulates WebLOAD testing resources (Virtual Clients and Probing  Clients) amongst users on a \u201cneed to use\u201d basis. The Resource Manager is  packaged with a maximum number of Virtual Clients, Probing Clients and  Connected Workstation ports, as defined by the WebLOAD package.  With the Resource Manager, every  WebLOAD Console can operate in Standalone Workstation mode or Connected  Workstation mode. Response  Data Size The size, in bytes, of all the  HTTP responses sent by the SUT during the last reporting interval.  WebLOAD  uses this value to calculate Throughput (bytes per second). Response  Time The time  it takes the SUT to send the object of an HTTP request back to a Virtual  Client, in seconds. In other words, the time from the end of the HTTP request  until the Virtual Client has received the complete item it requested.  The value posted in the Current  Value column is the average time  it took the SUT to respond to an HTTP request during the last reporting interval. Responses The  number of times the SUT responded to an HTTP request during the last  reporting interval.  This  number should match the number of successful hits. Round  Time The time  it takes one Virtual Client to finish one complete iteration of a script, in  seconds.  The  value posted in the Current Value column is the average time it took the  Virtual Clients to finish one complete iteration of the script during the  last reporting interval. Rounds The  total number of times the Virtual Clients attempted to run the script during  the last reporting interval. Rounds  Per Second The number of times the Virtual  Clients attempted to run the script, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.  The  value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of attempts  (both successful and unsuccessful) per second during the last reporting  interval. Send  Time The time  it takes the Virtual Client to write an HTTP request to the SUT, in seconds.  The value posted in the Current  Value column is the average time it took the Virtual Clients to write a  request to the SUT during the last reporting interval. Server  Performance Measurements If you selected Performance  Monitor statistics for the report, WebLOAD creates a row for them and reports their values in the Statistics Report.  For definitions of the  statistics, see the Server Monitor  Definition dialog box.  Be  selective when choosing server performance measurements, otherwise the system  resources required to manage the data might affect the Console. Session  Tree A graphic representation of a  Load Template and status. It illustrates the different components of a test  session, including Load Machines and Probing Clients, the scripts that they  execute, and their status. Single  Client See Probing   Client. Standard  Deviation The average amount the  measurement varies from the average since the beginning of the test. Successful  Connections The  total number of times the Virtual Clients were able to successfully connect to the SUT during the last reporting  interval.  This number is always less than  or equal to the number of successful hits because several hits might use the same HTTP connection if the Persistent  Connection option is enabled. Successful  Hits The  total number of times the Virtual Clients made an HTTP request and received  the correct HTTP response from the SUT during the last reporting interval.  Each request for each gif, jpeg, html file,  etc., is a single hit. Successful  Hits Per Second The  number of times the Virtual Clients obtained the correct HTTP response to  their HTTP requests divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.  The  value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of successful  HTTP requests per second during the last reporting interval. Successful  Pages Per Second The  value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of successful  requests per second during the last reporting interval. Successful  Rounds The  total number of times the Virtual Clients completed one iteration of the  script during the last reporting interval. Successful  Rounds Per Second The  number of times the Virtual Clients completed an entire iteration of the  script, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.  The  value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of successful  iterations of the script per second during the last reporting interval. SUT The  system running the Web application currently under test. The SUT (System  Under Test) is accessed by clients through its URL address. The SUT can  reside on any machine or on multiple machines, anywhere on the global  Internet or your local intranet. Template See Load Template. Templates  Gallery The  Templates Gallery is a single entity that contains predefined templates,  user-defined templates, and portfolios. Test  Program See Test Script. Test  Script The  script. This defines the test scenario used in your Load Session. Scripts are  written in JavaScript. Test  Template See Load Template. TestTalk The  network agent. This program enables communication between the Console and the  host computers participating in the test. Throttle  Control A  WebLOAD component that enables you to dynamically change the Load Size while  a test session is in progress. Throughput  (Bytes Per Second) The  average number of bytes per second transmitted from the SUT to the Virtual  Clients running the script during the last reporting interval. In other  words, this is the amount of the Response Data Size, divided by the number of  seconds in the reporting interval. Time  to First Byte The time  it takes from when a request is sent until the Virtual Client receives the  first byte of data. User-defined  Automatic Data Collection If  you have Automatic Data Collection enabled, WebLOAD creates three counters  for each GET and POST statement in  the script.  \u009f The total number of times the Get and Post statements occurred  \u009f The number of times the statements succeeded  The number of times the statements failed during the last reporting interval User-defined  counters Your own  counters that you can add to scripts using the SendCounter() and the SendMeasurement() functions (see the WebLOAD Scripting Guide). If there is a  user-defined counter in the script that you are running, WebLOAD reports the  counter\u2019s values in the Statistics Report.  The row heading is the name  (argument) of the counter, that  is, the string in parenthesis in the SendCounter() or  SendMeasurement() function  call.  The value reported is the number  of times the counter was  incremented during the last reporting interval. User-defined  timer Timers  that you can add to scripts to keep track of the amount of time it takes to  complete specific actions (see the WebLOAD Scripting Guide). If there  are any timers in the scripts that you are running, WebLOAD reports their  values in the Statistics Report.  The  row heading is the name (argument) of the timer. That is, the row heading is  the string in parenthesis in the SetTimer() function call. The timer represents the time it  takes to complete all the actions between the SetTimer() call and its corresponding SendTimer() call,  in seconds.  The  value posted is the average time it took a Virtual Client to complete the  actions between the pair of timer calls, in seconds, during the last  reporting interval. User-defined  Transaction counters Transaction  functions that you can add to scripts for functional tests (see the WebLOAD  Scripting Guide). If there is a user-defined transaction function in the  script that you are running, WebLOAD reports three counters for it in the  Statistics Report.  \u009f The total number of times the  transaction occurred  \u009f The number of times a transaction succeeded  \u009f The number of times a transaction failed  during the last reporting interval  The  row heading is the name (argument) of the transaction. That is, the row  heading is the string in parenthesis in the BeginTransaction() function call User-defined  Transactions timers A timer for user-defined transaction functions. If  there is a user-defined transaction function in the script that you are  running, WebLOAD reports a timer for it in the Statistics Report.  The  row heading is the name (argument) of the user- defined transaction. That is,  the row heading is the string in parenthesis in the BeginTransaction() function call.  The timer represents the average  time it took to complete all the actions between the BeginTransaction() call and its corresponding EndTransaction() call, in seconds, during the last reporting  interval. Virtual  Client Artificial  entities run by Load Generators. Each such entity is a perfect simulation of  a real client accessing the System Under Test (SUT) through a Web browser.  Virtual Clients generate HTTP  calls that access the SUT. The  Load Generators that run Virtual Clients can reside anywhere on the Internet  or on your local intranet.  Scripts  are executed by all the Virtual Clients in parallel, achieving simultaneous  access to the SUT. The size of the load on your SUT is determined by the  number of Virtual Clients being  generated. You may define as many Virtual Clients as needed, up to the  maximum supported by your WebLOAD \u201cpackage\u201d. WebLOAD  Analytics WebLOAD  Analytics enables you to analyze data and create custom, informative reports  after running a WebLOAD test session. WebLOAD  Console See Console.

An important phase of the performance testing process is the analysis and reporting of test results. WebLOAD Analytics provides you with a simple yet comprehensive method of producing and publishing reports to fulfill all your analysis and reporting requirements. </p> <p>Using WebLOAD Analytics, you can create clear, accurate, and meaningful reports that enable you to analyze Load Session results and identify peaks, trends, and anomalies in your data. WebLOAD Analytics provides you with a variety of predefined chart templates that enable you to produce focused reports on specific topics. You can edit these templates, and create new templates. </p>"},{"location":"analytics-user-guide/overview/#the-webload-analytics-workflow","title":"The WebLOAD Analytics Workflow","text":"<p>WebLOAD Analytics provides an easy to use, task oriented interface for the production and publication of Load Session reports. In a typical workflow, you create several charts of interest. Each is created simply by double-clicking a template. You then generate a Report, which is a compilation of the open charts.  </p> <p>The building blocks of the charts are:</p> <ul> <li>Load Sessions \u2013 WebLOAD Analytics uses Load Session data as the raw material for producing WebLOAD reports. Using WebLOAD Analytics, you can present Load Session results, compare various statistics, and highlight important results and conclusions, based on your load test results. For more information about Load Sessions, seeWorking with Load Sessions on page 51 . </li> <li>Templates \u2013 A template specifies the design of a chart, including the visual layout, chart elements, and the way the data is structured. WebLOAD Analytics provides a wide range of predefined templates, based on RadView\u2019s extensive knowledge and experience in the load testing and performance analysis fields. Predefined templates enable you to produce charts that focus on specific aspects of the Load Session data.</li> </ul> <p>A basic chart consists of the following elements: </p> <ul> <li>Tabular Data \u2013 Provides a tabular representation of the Load Session data. </li> <li>Graphs \u2013 Provides a graphical representation of the Load Session data. </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Each chart is either static or interactive.  </p> <ul> <li>A static chart, indicated by, is a regular chart.  </li> <li>An interactive chart is indicated by . It has the additional capability of enabling you to analyze and present the chart data in various ways using tools provided in its interactive toolbar. </li> </ul> <p>Once you create all the charts necessary for your report, you can generate the report simply by clicking . You then specify which of the open charts will be included in the report. </p> <p>Reports can be saved for later use, with the defined Load Session data, template, and any optional settings you choose (seeSaving Reports on page 48). </p> <p>In addition, you can: </p> <ul> <li>Apply filters to the Load Session data \u2013 You can apply time and statistics-based filters to the Load Session data before the chart is produced. Time filters focus the chart on a specific part of the Load Session. Statistics-based time filters enable you to focus on time segments which meet defined criteria. For information about filtering your chart, seeChanging Chart Settings on page 35. </li> <li>Customize your graphs \u2013 You can customize the graphs of interactive charts (denoted by the  icon): change colors, line type, hide/show measurement, zoom and more. You can even add any other measurement from the session to the graphs. </li> <li>Change the chart\u2019s parameters \u2013 each chart has different parameters that can be changed to control its behavior. Depending on the chart, you may add threshold values, control whether to show detailed data table or not, change titles and logos. For more information, seeModifying Chart Parameters on page 43. </li> <li>Reuse your customizations \u2013 You can change the settings of a template and then save it as a new template. </li> <li>Create regression charts \u2013 Adding multiple Load Sessions to a chart compares one selected session to all additional sessions included in the regression chart. This option is very useful for comparing two sessions that were run on the same Load Template. The purpose is to gauge whether a small change in the System Under Test has degraded the performance. For more information, seeGenerating Charts on page 21. </li> <li>Create statistical correlation charts \u2013 You can use these charts to identify measurements that have a high correlation with a certain measurement that is behaving in an unusual fashion, and are therefore possibly causing the unusual behavior of that measurement. </li> <li>Print or Publish the chart or report \u2013 Both charts and reports can be printed or published in a variety of formats, including DOC, ODT, PDF, HTML, RTF and XLSX. For information about printing charts and reports, seePrinting a Chart on page 27 andPrinting a Report on page 47. For information about publishing charts and Reports, seePublishing Charts on page 34 andPublishing Reports on page 47. </li> <li>Group frequently used templates in a portfolio \u2013 You can create a portfolio of templates that you use frequently. Opening the portfolio will open all its included templates. For information about how to set up a portfolio, seeWorking with Portfolios on page 64. </li> <li> <p>Manage your charts \u2013 You can group your templates into different categories by creating your own folders and moving the templates you wish to use into those folders. You can also rename folders to create logical categories in which to group your templates. For information about managing your templates, seeManaging Template Categories on page 59. </p> </li> <li> <p>Assign and modify master templates \u2013 WebLOAD Analytics contains three master templates: Raw, WebLOAD, and WebLOAD with background. Any one of these can be assigned as the master template for reports, and any one of these can be assigned as the master template for charts. By default, the reports master template is the WebLOAD master template, and the default charts master template is the Raw master template. The appearance of a report is determined only by the reports master template. The appearance of each chart is determined both by the chart master template and the settings of the specific template. You can specify which master template to assign to charts and which master template to assign to reports (seeDefining Your Analytics Preferences on page 67). You can also change the values of some master template parameters (seeDefining Your Parameter Preferences on page 71). </p> </li> <li>Create and edit static reports \u2013 Although it is possible to dynamically define an interactive report from any measurement set, you can even create and edit the static templates. You can use the freely available iReport tool to edit the supplied templates and create new ones.

However, for testing purposes, you may wish to create peak server loads that stress your system to the limit by deliberately forcing multiple Virtual Clients to perform key tasks and execute a given command at precisely the same moment in real time.</p> <p>WebLOAD provides Synchronization Points to coordinate the actions of multiple Virtual Clients. A Synchronization Point is a meeting place where Virtual Clients wait before continuing with a script. When one Virtual Client arrives at a Synchronization Point, WebLOAD holds the Client at that point until all the other Virtual Clients arrive. When all the Virtual Clients have arrived, they are all released at once to perform the next action in the script simultaneously.</p> <p>For example, suppose that you want to simulate 500 users, all trying to access a form on the same Web page simultaneously. To maximize the impact of this test situation, all 500 Virtual Clients must access the form at exactly the same time. Add a Synchronization Point before the form entry node to ensure that all the Virtual Clients log in simultaneously.</p> <p>WebLOAD Recorder enables you to define the meeting place where all Virtual Clients wait. You can also optionally set the timeout value, the number of milliseconds that WebLOAD will wait for all of the Virtual Clients to arrive at the Synchronization Point. The timeout is a safety mechanism that prevents an infinite wait if any of the Virtual Clients does not arrive at the Synchronization Point for any reason. Once the timeout period expires, WebLOAD releases the rest of the Virtual Clients. Setting a timeout</p> <p>value is important to ensure that the test session will not \u2018hang\u2019 indefinitely in case of error.</p> <p>To insert a Synchronization Point:</p> <ol> <li>Drag the Synchronization Point  icon from the Load toolbox into the Script Tree directly before the action you want all Virtual Clients to perform simultaneously. The Synchronization Point dialog box opens.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>In the Timeout Value field, enter or select a timeout value for the Synchronization Point. The default value is 1000 milliseconds.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Synchronization Point item appears in the Script Tree and the JavaScript code is added to the script. To see the new JavaScript code, view the script in JavaScript Editing mode.</p> </li> </ol> <p>During a test session, the SynchronizationPoint() function returns a value to WebLOAD. This value indicates whether the function was successful or not. All failures are logged and displayed in the WebLOAD and Console Log windows, similar to any other WebLOAD test failure.</p> <p>Synchronization Point function calls may return one of the following return values:</p> <ul> <li>WLSuccess\u2014synchronization succeeded. All Virtual Clients arrived at the Synchronization Point and were released together.</li> <li>WLLoadChanged\u2014synchronization failed. A change in the load size was detected while Virtual Clients were being held at the Synchronization Point. All Virtual clients were released.</li> <li>WLTimeout\u2014synchronization failed.

It is replaced by WebLOAD Recorder. Aborted Rounds The number of times the Virtual Clients started to run a script but did not complete the script, during the last reporting interval. This might be due to a session being stopped either automatically or manually by the user. Script Specification of the sequence of HTTP protocol calls sent by Virtual Clients to the SUT (System Under Test). scripts are written in JavaScript. You can either write scripts as a text file or generate them automatically using the WebLOAD Recorder. Application Being Tested (ABT) See SUT. Attempted Connections The total number of times the Virtual Clients attempted to connect to the SUT during the last reporting interval. Automatic Transaction counters <p>If you have Automatic Transactions enabled, WebLOAD creates three counters for each GET and POST statement in the script:</p><p>- The total number of times it occurred</p><p>- The number of times it succeeded</p><p>- The number of times it failed during the last reporting interval.</p> Average For timers, average is the total amount of time counted by the timer (not the elapsed time) divided by the Count (that is, the total number of readings). For example, the average for Transaction Time is the amount of time it took to complete all the successful transactions, divided by the number of successful transactions (the Count). Built-in Timer A timer measures the time required to perform a given task. WebLOAD supports both programmed timers and built-in timers. ROUND TIME is a built-in timer. The ROUND TIME is the time needed for one complete execution of a script. Connect Time <p>The time it takes for a Virtual Client to connect to the System Under Test (the SUT), in seconds. In other words, the time it takes from the beginning of the HTTP request to the TCP/IP connection.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the average time it took a Virtual Client to connect to the SUT during the last reporting interval.</p><p>If the Persistent Connection option is enabled, there may not be a value for Connect Time because the HTTP connection remains open between successive HTTP requests.</p> Connection Speed (Bits Per Second) <p>The number of bits transmitted back and forth between the Virtual Clients and the System Under Test (SUT), divided by the time it took to transmit those bits, in seconds.</p><p>You can set the Virtual Clients to emulate a particular connection speed during the test, either by using the Variable Connection Speed settings, or by coding the connection speed in the script.</p><p>If a connection speed is specified for the test, WebLOAD reports it in the Statistics Report.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of bits passed per second during the last reporting interval. It should match, very closely, the connection speed you specified for the test.</p> Console <p>The WebLOAD component that manages the test session.</p><p>The Console performs the following:</p><p>- Configures Load Session hosts and scripts</p><p>- Schedules Load Session scripts</p><p>- Configures Goal\u2013Oriented test sessions</p><p>- Monitors the application's performance under the generated load</p><p>- Manages the Load Session as it is running, allowing you to pause, stop, and continue Load Session components as needed</p><p>- Displays the current performance of the SUT</p><p>- Provides a final performance reports for Probing Clients and Virtual Clients</p><p>- Manages exporting of performance reports</p> Count (For timers only.) The  total number of readings (the number of times the item being timed has  occurred) for the timed statistic since the beginning of the test. For  example, for Transaction Time, Count shows the number of transactions that  have been completed. Current  Slice The value posted for this reporting  interval in the Statistics Report main window. Current  Slice Average For per time unit statistics and counters, average is the total of  all of the current values for the last reporting interval, divided by the  number of readings.  For timers, average is the  total amount of time counted by the timer (not the elapsed time), divided by  the Count (that is, the total number of readings for the last reporting  interval). For example, the average for Transaction Time is the amount of  time it took to complete all the successful transactions in the last  reporting interval, divided by the number of successful transactions (the  Current Slice Count). Current  Slice Count (For timers only.) The total number of  readings (the number of times the item being timed has occurred) for the  timed statistic for the last reporting interval. For example, for Transaction  Time, Current Slice Count shows the number of transactions that have been  completed over the last reporting interval. Current  Slice Max The highest value reported for this statistic over the last reporting  interval. Current  Slice Min The lowest value reported for this statistic over the last reporting  interval. Current  Slice Standard Deviation The average amount the measurement for this statistic varies from the  average over the last reporting interval. Current  Slice Sum The aggregate or total  value for this statistic in this script over the last reporting interval. DNS Lookup  Time The time it takes to  resolve the host name and convert it to an IP address by calling the DNS  server. Failed Connections The total number of times  the Virtual Clients tried to connect to the SUT but were unsuccessful, during  the last reporting interval.  This number is always less  than or equal to the number of failed hits because hits can fail for reasons  other than a failed connection. Failed Hits The total number of times the Virtual Clients made an HTTP request but did not receive the correct HTTP response from the SUT during the last reporting interval. Note that each request for each gif, jpeg, html file, etc., is a single hit. Failed Hits Per Second <p>The number of times the Virtual Clients did not obtain the correct HTTP response, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of unsuccessful HTTP requests per second during the last reporting interval.</p> Failed Pages Per Second <p>The number of times the Virtual Clients did not obtain the correct response to an upper level request, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of unsuccessful requests per second during the last reporting interval.</p> Failed Rounds The total number of times the Virtual Clients started but did not complete the script during the last reporting interval. Failed Rounds Per Second The number of times the Virtual Clients started but did not complete an iteration of the script, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds. The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of failed iterations of the script per second during the last reporting interval. First Byte The time it takes a Virtual Client to receive the first byte of data. Gallery See Templates Gallery. Goal\u2013Oriented Test <p>A WebLOAD component enabling you to define the performance goals required, and view the status of your application when it is operating under this performance goal. WebLOAD provides a Goal\u2013Oriented Test Wizard for configuring these performance goals. WebLOAD automatically accelerates the number of Virtual Clients accessing your website until you meet your performance goal.</p><p>Note: The Goal-Oriented Test Wizard was previously called the Cruise Control Wizard.</p> Goal\u2013Oriented Test Wizard See Goal\u2013Oriented Test. Hit Time <p>The time it takes to complete a successful HTTP request, in seconds. Each request for each gif, jpeg, html file, etc., is a single hit. The time of a hit is the sum of the Connect Time, Send Time, Response Time, and Process Time.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the average time it took to make an HTTP request and process its response during the last reporting interval.</p> Hits <p>The total number of times the Virtual Clients made HTTP requests to the System Under Test (SUT) during the last reporting interval.</p><p>For example, a Get statement for a URL retrieves a page. The page can include any number of graphics and contents files. Each request for each gif, jpeg, html file, etc., is a single hit.</p> Hits Per Second <p>The number of times the Virtual Clients made an HTTP request, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds. Each request for each gif, jpeg, html file, etc. is a single hit.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of HTTP requests per second during the last reporting interval.</p> Host A computer connected via a network, participating in a test session. Each Host in a test session has assigned tasks. A host can act as either a Load Machine or a Probing Client Machine. All hosts participating in a test session must be accessible to the Console over a network. Therefore they must run TestTalk, the network agent. HTTP Response Status <p>WebLOAD creates a row in the Statistics Report for each kind of HTTP status code it receives as an HTTP response from the SUT (redirection codes, success codes, server error codes, or client error codes).</p><p>The value posted is the number of times the Virtual Clients received that status code during the last reporting interval.</p> Integrated Report A single configurable report that can integrate both standard performance data, and data from the NT Performance Monitor. This report gives you a more complete picture of the performance of your application. The data to be monitored and the data to be displayed in the report are both configurable in the Console. Internet Productivity Pack (IPP) Provides a set of protocol implementations enabling you to load-test your application using these protocols. Java and ActiveX counters <p>You can add function calls to your scripts that enable you to instantiate and call methods and properties in Java and ActiveX components (see the WebLOAD Scripting Guide). If there are ActiveX or Java function calls in the script that you are running, WebLOAD reports three counters for them in the Statistics Report:</p><p>- The total number of times it occurred</p><p>- The number of times it succeeded</p><p>- The number of times it failed during the last reporting interval.</p><p>The row heading in the Statistics Report is the name of the function call.</p> Java and ActiveX timers <p>You can add function calls to your scripts that enable you to instantiate and call methods and properties in Java and ActiveX components (see the WebLOAD Scripting Guide). If there are ActiveX or Java function calls in the script you are running, WebLOAD reports timers for them in the Statistics Report.</p><p>The timer value is the average amount of time it took to complete the function call, in seconds, during the last reporting interval.</p><p>The row heading in the Statistics Report is the name of the function call.</p> Load Generator The component of the Load Machine that generates Virtual Clients. Load Generators have the task of bombarding the System Under Test with HTTP protocol call requests as defined in the script. WebLOAD assesses the application's performance by measuring the response time experienced by the Virtual Clients. The number of Virtual Clients at any given moment is determined by the user. Load Generator Machine See Load Machine. Load Machine A host that runs Load Generators. Load Generators bombard the application under test with a large load, to enable complete scalability and integrity testing. Load Session <p>A Load Session includes both the complete Load Template and the results obtained while running that Load Session. A Load Template consists of information about the hosts and scripts participating in the current Load Session. The Load Template will also include scheduling information. The complete Load Template is illustrated in the Session Tree. Storing a Load Template saves you time when repeatedly running WebLOAD with the same, or even a similar network configuration, since you don't have to recreate your Load Template from scratch each time you want to start working.</p><p>Storing Load Session results can be useful when you want to examine results from multiple test sessions or for analyzing test session results.</p> Load Size The number of Virtual Clients running during the last reporting interval. Load Template A Load Template contains the complete Load Session definition, without the test results. A Load Template includes information about the participating hosts and the scripts used in the current Load Session. The definition also includes scheduling information and the configuration of the Server Monitor and Integrated Reports. The complete Load Template is illustrated in the Session Tree. Storing a Load Template saves you time when repeatedly running WebLOAD with the same, or even a similar network configuration, since you do not have to recreate your Load Template from scratch each time you rerun a test. Page Time <p>The time it takes to complete a successful upper level request, in seconds. The Page Time is the sum of the Connection Time, Send Time, Response Time, and Process Time for all the hits on a page.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the average time it took the Virtual Clients to make an upper level request and process its response during the last reporting interval.</p> Pages The total number of times the Virtual Client made upper level requests, both successful and unsuccessful, during the last reporting interval. Pages Per Second <p>The number of times the Virtual Clients made upper level requests divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of requests per second during the last reporting interval.</p> Per Time Unit statistics Ratios that calculate an average value for an action or process. For example: Transactions Per Second, Rounds Per Second. Portfolio A Portfolio of reports enables you to generate a single, inclusive report that contains all the charts generated by the templates included in the portfolio. Probing Client A software program which \"bombards\" the SUT as a single Virtual Client, to further measure the performance of the SUT. WebLOAD generates exact values for Probing Client performance. Probing Client Machines Hosts running Probing Client software simulating one Virtual Client, and running at the same time as Load Machines. Probing Client software See Probing Client. Process Time <p>The time it takes WebLOAD to parse an HTTP response from the SUT and then populate the document-object model (DOM), in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the average time it took WebLOAD to parse an HTTP response during the last reporting interval.</p> Receive Time The elapsed time between receiving the first byte and the last byte. Report Portfolio See Portfolio. Resource Manager <p>Distributes and circulates WebLOAD testing resources (Virtual Clients and Probing Clients) amongst users on a \"need to use\" basis. The Resource Manager is packaged with a maximum number of Virtual Clients, Probing Clients and Connected Workstation ports, as defined by the WebLOAD package.</p><p>With the Resource Manager, every WebLOAD Console can operate in Standalone Workstation mode or Connected Workstation mode.</p> Response Data Size <p>The size, in bytes, of all the HTTP responses sent by the SUT during the last reporting interval.</p><p>WebLOAD uses this value to calculate Throughput (bytes per second).</p> Response Time <p>The time it takes the SUT to send the object of an HTTP request back to a Virtual Client, in seconds. In other words, the time from the end of the HTTP request until the Virtual Client has received the complete item it requested.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the average time it took the SUT to respond to an HTTP request during the last reporting interval.</p> Responses <p>The number of times the SUT responded to an HTTP request during the last reporting interval.</p><p>This number should match the number of successful hits.</p> Round Time <p>The time it takes one Virtual Client to finish one complete iteration of a script, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the average time it took the Virtual Clients to finish one complete iteration of the script during the last reporting interval.</p> Rounds The total number of times the Virtual Clients attempted to run the script during the last reporting interval. Rounds Per Second <p>The number of times the Virtual Clients attempted to run the script, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of attempts (both successful and unsuccessful) per second during the last reporting interval.</p> Send Time <p>The time it takes the Virtual Client to write an HTTP request to the SUT, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the average time it took the Virtual Clients to write a request to the SUT during the last reporting interval.</p> Server Performance Measurements <p>If you selected Performance Monitor statistics for the report, WebLOAD creates a row for them and reports their values in the Statistics Report.</p><p>For definitions of the statistics, see the Server Monitor Definition dialog box.</p><p>Be selective when choosing server performance measurements , otherwise the system resources required to manage the data might affect the Console.</p> Session Tree A graphic representation of a Load Template and status. It illustrates the different components of a test session, including Load Machines and Probing Clients, the scripts that they execute, and their status. Single Client See Probing Client. Standard Deviation The average amount the measurement varies from the average since the beginning of the test. Successful Connections <p>The total number of times the Virtual Clients were able to successfully connect to the SUT during the last reporting interval.</p><p>This number is always less than or equal to the number of successful hits because several hits might use the same HTTP connection if the Persistent Connection option is enabled.</p> Successful Hits The total number of times the Virtual Clients made an HTTP request and received the correct HTTP response from the SUT during the last reporting interval. Each request for each gif, jpeg, html file, etc., is a single hit. Successful Hits Per Second <p>The number of times the Virtual Clients obtained the correct HTTP response to their HTTP requests divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of successful HTTP requests per second during the last reporting interval.</p> Successful Pages Per Second The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of successful requests per second during the last reporting interval. Successful Rounds The total number of times the Virtual Clients completed one iteration of the script during the last reporting interval. Successful Rounds Per Second <p>The number of times the Virtual Clients completed an entire iteration of the script, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of successful iterations of the script per second during the last reporting interval.</p> SUT The system running the Web application currently under test. The SUT (System Under Test) is accessed by clients through its URL address. The SUT can reside on any machine or on multiple machines, anywhere on the global Internet or your local intranet. Template See Load Template. Templates Gallery The Templates Gallery is a single entity that contains predefined templates, user-defined templates, and portfolios. Test Program See Test Script. Test Script The script. This defines the test scenario used in your Load Session. Scripts are written in JavaScript. Test Template See Load Template. TestTalk The network agent. This program enables communication between the Console and the host computers participating in the test. Throttle Control A WebLOAD component that enables you to dynamically change the Load Size while a test session is in progress. Throughput (Bytes Per Second) The average number of bytes per second transmitted from the SUT to the Virtual Clients running the script during the last reporting interval. In other words, this is the amount of the Response Data Size, divided by the number of seconds in the reporting interval. Time to First Byte The time that elapsed since a request was sent until the Virtual Client received the first byte of data. User-defined Automatic Data Collection <p>If you have Automatic Data Collection enabled, WebLOAD creates three counters for each GET and POST statement in the script:</p><p>- The total number of times the Get and Post statements occurred</p><p>- The number of times the statements succeeded</p><p>- The number of times the statements failed during the last reporting interval.</p> User-defined counters <p>Your own counters that you can add to scripts using the SendCounter() and the SendMeasurement() functions (see the WebLOAD Scripting Guide). If there is a user-defined counter in the script that you are running, WebLOAD reports the counter\u2019s values in the Statistics Report.</p><p>The row heading is the name (argument) of the counter. That is, the row heading is the string in parenthesis in the SendCounter() or SendMeasurement() function call.</p><p>The value reported is the number of times the counter was incremented during the last reporting interval.</p> User-defined timer <p>Timers that you can add to scripts to keep track of the amount of time it takes to complete specific actions (see the WebLOAD Scripting Guide). If there are any timers in the scripts that you are running, WebLOAD reports their values in the Statistics Report.</p><p>The row heading is the name (argument) of the timer. That is, the row heading is the string in parenthesis in the SetTimer() function call. The timer represents the time it takes to complete all the actions between the SetTimer() call and its corresponding SendTimer() call, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted is the average time it took a Virtual Client to complete the actions between the pair of timer calls, in seconds, during the last reporting interval.</p> User-defined Transaction counters <p>Transaction functions that you can add to scripts for functional tests (see the WebLOAD Scripting Guide). If there is a user-defined transaction function in the script that you are running, WebLOAD reports three counters for it in the Statistics Report:</p><p>- The total number of times the transaction occurred</p><p>- The number of times a transaction succeeded</p><p>- The number of times a transaction failed during the last reporting interval.</p><p>The row heading is the name (argument) of the transaction. That is, the row heading is the string in parenthesis in the BeginTransaction() function call.</p> User-defined Transactions timers <p>A timer for user-defined transaction functions. If there is a user-defined transaction function in the script that you are running, WebLOAD reports a timer for it in the Statistics Report.</p><p>The row heading is the name (argument) of the user- defined transaction. That is, the row heading is the string in parenthesis in the BeginTransaction() function call.</p><p>The timer represents the average time it took to complete all the actions between the BeginTransaction() call and its corresponding EndTransaction() call, in seconds, during the last reporting interval.</p> Virtual Client <p>Artificial entities run by Load Generators. Each such entity is a perfect simulation of a real client accessing the System Under Test (SUT) through a Web browser.</p><p>Virtual Clients generate HTTP calls that access the SUT. The Load Generators that run Virtual Clients can reside anywhere on the Internet or on your local intranet. scripts are executed by all the Virtual Clients in parallel, achieving simultaneous access to the SUT. The size of the load on your SUT is determined by the number of Virtual Clients being generated. You may define as many Virtual Clients as needed, up to the maximum</p><p>supported by your WebLOAD \u201cpackage.\u201d</p> WebLOAD Analytics WebLOAD Analytics enables you to analyze data, and create custom, informative reports after running a WebLOAD test session.

Redirection limit Sets the redirection limit. Persistent Connection Persistent connection (keep-alive) When enabled, WebLOAD Recorder keeps an HTTP connection alive between successive accesses in the same round of the main script. Keeping a connection alive saves time between accesses. WebLOAD attempts to keep the connection alive unless you switch to a different server. However, some HTTP servers may refuse to keep a connection alive. You should not keep a connection alive if establishing the connection is part of the performance test. HTTP properties Gzip support <p>Sets the wlGlobals.AcceptEncodingGzip flag.</p><p>When this flag is set, WebLOAD Recorder behaves as follows:</p><p>1. For each request, sends the header \u201cAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\u201d. This informs the server that the client can accept zipped content.</p><p>2. When this header is turned on, the server MAY send a response with the header \u201ccontent-encoding: gzip\u201d or \u201ccontent-encoding: deflate\u201d. If either of these headers is sent, it means that the response is zipped/deflated and WebLOAD Recorder will unzip/inflate the content.</p><p></p><p>Note: Most servers will work correctly even if the client does not send the \u201cAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\u201d header.</p><p>Therefore, unless needed, it is recommended not to set the wlGlobals.AcceptEncodingGzip flag because it is performance heavy. However, some servers will fail if it is not sent. Microsoft Internet Explorer/Mozilla sends it by default.</p><p></p><p>You can manually code the script to send the \u201cAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\u201d header even if the wlGlobals.AcceptEncodingGzip flag is not set. In this case, if the server returns zipped content, WebLOAD Recorder will not unzip it.</p> Character Encoding Select the character encoding value Contains the value corresponding to the character set being used.

The WebLOAD correlation engine helps you overcome one of the main challenges of recording or replaying Web application load tests: dynamic data.</p> <p>Dynamically generated data changes every time you run a Web application. For example, the session ID that uniquely identifies a user\u2019s active session is allocated by the Web server or the application every time such a session is initiated. (The session ID is also used for session management. For more information, see Session Management on page 107.) Such dynamic data cannot simply be recorded as is and played back, because the playback will inevitably fail.</p> <p>WebLOAD enables you to correlate the most common methods used to pass dynamic data between a server and a client. The methods are:</p> <ul> <li>Cookies \u2013 This method is mostly used for session management, but cookies may also contain additional dynamic data sent from a server. In most situations, the browser returns the sent cookie in subsequent requests. This scenario is handled automatically by WebLOAD and no additional correlation activities are required. WebLOAD also supports cases where a value received in a cookie is sent as request data or a cookie is created in the client-side JavaScript.</li> <li>URL rewriting \u2013 This method is most commonly resolved by assigning the returned Session ID to a local variable and using this variable throughout the rest of the script.</li> <li>Hidden form fields \u2013 This method is most commonly used for passing localized dynamic data that is not necessarily within the scope of the full session.</li> <li>Any response content \u2013 Some applications return dynamic data within various types of HTTP responses, including client-side JavaScript and XML content.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"recorder-user-guide/correlating_scripts/#about-correlating-scripts-with-webload-recorder","title":"About Correlating Scripts with WebLOAD Recorder","text":"<p>WebLOAD contains a powerful rule based correlation engine.

In such cases, the Web servers can communicate the session IDs between the user\u2019s internet browser and the server through:</p> <ul> <li>Cookies \u2013 When a server receives a request to create a session, it creates a session object and associates this object with a session ID. The session ID is then transmitted back to the browser as part of a response header and is stored with the rest of the cookies in the browser. On subsequent requests from the browser, the session ID is transmitted as part of the request header, which enables the application to associate each request for a session ID with the previous requests from that user. The entire interaction between the browser, application server, and the application is transparent to the end user.</li> <li>URL rewriting \u2013 The session ID information is embedded by the server in the URL and is then received by the application with the HTTP GET command (for example, when the client clicks on an embedded link within a page).</li> <li>Hidden form fields \u2013 The session ID information is stored within the fields of a form and submitted to the application. Typically, the session ID information is embedded within the form as a hidden field and is submitted with the HTTP GET/POST command.</li> </ul> <p>The following sections provide information on how some of the most commonly used Web and application servers perform session management.</p>"},{"location":"recorder-user-guide/correlating_scripts/#ibm-websphere-application-server","title":"IBM WebSphere Application Server","text":"<p>The IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) supports all the session management methods listed in Session Management (on page 107), but works best with cookies (which is its default method). The WAS implementation of this method differs from a pure cookie-based method by using only one cookie, JSESSIONID, that contains only the session ID information. (A pure cookie-based method would use multiple cookies, containing possibly sensitive user state information, such as an account number or user ID.) JSESSIONID is used by the server to associate the request with the information already stored on the server for that session ID.</p> <p>In an HTTP session, all the attributes associated with a user\u2019s request are stored on the server.

These session ID values are generated using an algorithm that guarantees a unique and random result.

It contains a sequence of HTTP protocol calls sent by Virtual Clients to your System Under Test (SUT). For example, if you want to test the performance of your Web application when clients access a certain page, your script must contain the code for accessing the page.</p> <p>A script can be generated automatically using the recording tools supplied with WebLOAD Recorder, or it can be created manually by writing a script. This guide describes the recording tools supplied with WebLOAD Recorder for developing test scripts automatically and provides instructions for developing test scripts manually.</p> <p>Before creating a script, you should consider and plan which actions you want to include in a test session.</p> <p>Create a script by carrying out the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>Recording the script.</li> <li>Editing / enhancing the script.</li> <li>Running and debugging the script.</li> </ol> <p>The first step of creating a script is recording. As you execute a typical sequence of activities, WebLOAD Recorder records your accesses, creating a precise, detailed record of all your activities and application responses that occur during a recording session.</p> <p>WebLOAD Recorder operates in conjunction with a Web browser, such as Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer. The basic \u2018Building Blocks\u2019 of a test session are your actions. As you work with a test application in the browser, (navigating between pages, typing text into a form, clicking the mouse, and so on), WebLOAD Recorder stores information about you actions in a script file. Externally, your activities are represented in WebLOAD Recorder by a set of icons arranged in a Visual Script Tree. Internally, WebLOAD Recorder records these actions and automatically creates scripts that act as scripts, recreating the actions and verifying the functionality of Web sites under realistic conditions.</p> <p>The second step of creating a script is editing the code of the recorded script. This can be done in Visual Editing mode and/or JavaScript Editing mode. For example, if you want a script to vary a sequence of accesses, submit randomized data read from a file, or work with Java or COM components, a certain degree of programming is required. This guide describes how to edit the code in your scripts to add more complex functionality to your testing sessions.</p> <p>The last step is to run your script in WebLOAD Recorder to perform testing so you can emulate how your script will run when executed in WebLOAD. You can then use the debugging tools to correct or modify your script so that it acts as you expected.</p> <p>After completing these basic steps, you can incorporate your script into a WebLOAD test.</p> <p>Note: For examples of basic scripts, see the WebLOAD Scripting Guide. </p>"},{"location":"recorder-user-guide/overview/#the-recording-tool","title":"The Recording Tool","text":"<p>WebLOAD Recorder is supplied with a recording tool to perform the following:</p> <ul> <li>Recording on any site, including sites that use SSL security.</li> <li>Recording in any browser that supports a configurable proxy.</li> </ul> <p>The recording tool runs independently of the WebLOAD Recorder.

Proxy tunneling involves using an external utility to redirect the outgoing web traffic on the client machine. The redirection enforces the traffic to pass through WebLOAD\u2019s proxy recorder, which is listening on port 9884, during the recording stage.</p> <p>To record scripts using Proxy Tunneling:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Enable a port interception service on the client machine. Configure the service to redirect the outgoing traffic from the application to pass through WebLOAD\u2019s proxy. The following are possible methods for intercepting web application traffic:</p> </li> <li> <p>Use an external utility that is capable of controlling and rerouting HTTP traffic. For example, the Proxifier application, which is available at: http://www.proxifier.com.</p> </li> <li>Configure your firewall. Some firewalls provide advanced services of traffic manipulation.</li> <li> <p>Configure your hardware. Four to seven layer switches may be used for controlling and routing web based traffic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Configure WebLOAD Recorder\u2019s recording options as follows:</p> </li> <li> <p>Click Recording and Script Generation Options in the Tools tab of the ribbon.

However, to evaluate and test your Internet application most effectively, it is not enough to measure the total transaction turn-around time or throughput of the website. A website is often only the front-end for applications that reside behind the scenes, for back-end components that do the actual work for an application. Testing the components that stand behind your Internet application is essential for comprehensive Internet application testing. A detailed breakdown and analysis of the results of each user activity helps pinpoint the source of any potential bottlenecks or other problems, and expedites the work required for any corrections or improvements.</p> <p>WebLOAD fully supports component based testing. WebLOAD Recorder scripts do not simply measure the time required for transactions to a website to be completed. WebLOAD JavaScript script objects can also directly access the back-end applications that compose your Internet application.</p> <p>WebLOAD provides a single, uniform environment for all your testing needs. WebLOAD JavaScript is the single scripting language that is able to work seamlessly with COM, Java, and XML DOM, accessing the applications that use these technologies through a variety of protocols, or your own proprietary protocol, in addition to standard Web-site testing, adding power to and increasing the universal applicability of your testing scripts.</p> <p>This chapter introduces various component-based testing features.</p> <p>Syntax specifications for the WebLOAD objects that appear in the examples in this chapter are provided in the WebLOAD JavaScript Reference Guide.</p>"},{"location":"scripting-guide/advanced_javascript_features/#working-with-the-xml-dom","title":"Working with the XML DOM","text":"<p>XML is a meta-language developed by W3C to organize and transfer data in a generic, universally recognized manner. XML relies on a simple, logical structure that is both easy to learn and works quickly and reliably, focusing on transferring hard data only, with no formatting or presentation information. XML acts as a gateway between autonomous, heterogeneous, component-based systems. This allows users to connect or link to any platform. XML provides an elegant solution for Web masters who wish to reach a wide range of clients, working on any number of diverse systems.</p> <p>WebLOAD provides full support for work with the XML Document Object Model. Using XML DOM objects, WebLOAD scripts are able to both access XML site information, and generate new XML data to send back to the server for processing, taking advantage of all the additional benefits that XML provides.</p> <p>WebLOAD supports:</p> <ul> <li>Working with existing XML Data Islands. Data Islands are XML documents embedded within HTML documents. WebLOAD Recorder, like the IE Browser, produces an XML DOM object for each Data Island.</li> <li>Creating new XML DOM objects via the XML Object Constructor. WebLOAD supports XML Native Browsing through use of the XML Object Constructor.</li> <li>Parsing and manipulating any XML data, using the XML Parser Object.</li> </ul> <p>Both WebLOAD and the IE Browser use the MSXML parser to create XML DOM objects. Since WebLOAD XML DOM objects and Browser XML DOM objects are created by the same MSXML parser, the XML DOM objects that are produced for both WebLOAD and the IE Browser are identical.</p> <p>When working through the IE Browser, XML DOM objects are accessed through the all collection. When working through WebLOAD, XML DOM objects are accessed through the wlXmls collection. Since a WebLOAD XML DOM object is identical to an IE Browser XML DOM object, the WebLOAD XML DOM uses the same Document Interface (programming methods and properties) found in the IE Browser XML DOM.</p> <p>The next few sections of this guide explain basic XML concepts and usage. Look in the WebLOAD JavaScript Reference Guide for a description of the WebLOAD wlXmls collection syntax and for a complete list of the WebLOAD-supported XML DOM Interfaces.</p> <p>For more general XML support and cross platform capabilities, WebLOAD offers the XMLParserObject as another alternative for accessing XML data. The XMLParserObject is based on the open source Xerces XML parser. In addition to the multi-platform support, using this object will result in lower memory consumption and increased performance during load testing.</p> <p>The following sections contain examples using the XMLParserObject. For more information about the XMLParserObject please refer to the WebLOAD JavaScript Reference Guide.

Java includes a variety of useful features, such as Remote Method Invocation (RMI), which allows local developers to seamlessly access distributed application functions and procedures, and Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), which allows Java clients to interact with any ODBC- or JDBC-compliant database, whether it resides locally or on a remote server. By utilizing Java tools and classes, user applications are able to offer far greater power and capabilities than when working with simple HTML code alone. For this reason, over the past few years, Java has become one of the most popular development mediums for large-scale Internet applications.</p> <p>WebLOAD supports full Java access from your JavaScript scripts. Full Java support means that your WebLOAD scripts will not only test access time to an HTML page. WebLOAD scripts can also invoke and run local Java classes used by the Java applications embedded within an HTML page.

Test sessions that involve multiple Load Generators require a resident JVM with the correct environment variable settings on each Load Generator.</p> </li> <li> <p>Whether to install only the JRE or the complete JDK depends on your application\u2019s requirements. If you will be doing any development or compilation, install the complete JDK. Trying to compile Java class files (such as JavaClass.java) on a computer that does not have the JDK installed will trigger an error. The JDK must be installed on each computer on which Java files will be compiled. The JRE can not handle any compilation requests.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each system environment is slightly different. When setting the PATH or CLASSPATH environment variables for your system, substitute the actual path to the required Java directories and libraries on your system. Use the Environment tab in the System dialog box from the Windows Control Panel to set the environment variables.</p> </li> <li> <p>Environment variables must be set with the correct values before starting TestTalk or running any Load Generators. Make sure you first verify and set the environment variables through the Windows Control Panel and only then start TestTalk.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you do not have the correct Java class directories included in your PATH, your scripts may fail with the following WebLOAD error message:</p> </li> </ul> <p><code>WebLOAD</code> can\u2019t find jvm.dll</p> <p>If you receive this error message and your version of the JVM is 1.2 or higher, check your system PATH (through the Windows Control Panel) to be sure it points to the jvm.dll library.

COM technology provides universally reusable binary components. These components can be mixed and matched over versions and years, accessed by applications written in any of a variety of languages, running on any of a variety of platforms, located either locally or over a network. COM automation simplifies application development by maximizing component reusability while increasing the application\u2019s universality. Today, most Windows users rely on COM technology, often without even realizing it. For example, suppose you wish to work with a restricted website. Access to the application behind that website is controlled by a security database. To work with that application, you must first enter your name and password. A COM component will automatically access the database and verify your permission status.</p> <p>COM components are objects that consist of a combination of properties, methods, and interfaces. An object\u2019s interface is simply a set of methods together with a defined set of standards for what those methods do and how they are accessed, their parameters and return values. WebLOAD JavaScript provides direct object access to any component that has a COM wrapping and an IDispatch interface. These are known as ActiveX objects. See ActiveX Object Interfaces (on page 107), for more information.</p> <p>An ActiveX object is viewed and manipulated exactly as any other JavaScript object within the script. WebLOAD encapsulates COM automation functionality, providing an interface between JavaScript scripts and ActiveX objects. For example, a WebLOAD JavaScript script is able to fully test an ASP Web page or a Web page that manipulates an ADO database. In both of these technologies, ActiveX objects are widely used.</p> <p>This section of the guide explains how to work with ActiveX objects within your JavaScript script. For a detailed explanation of COM programming, see the Microsoft MSDN Online Library at http://msdn.microsoft.com (http://msdn.microsoft.com).</p> <p>Note: If you are working with COM objects that are not thread-safe and can not handle multi-threading, you must set the multithreading to one thread per process (this is WebLOAD\u2019s default setting).</p> <p>To set the multithreading:</p> <ol> <li>In the WebLOAD Console, open the Tools &gt; Default/Current Session/script Options dialog box.</li> <li>Select the Browser Parameters tab.</li> <li>In the Multi-thread Virtual Clients-&gt;Load Generator field, enter or scroll to 1, which sets one thread per process.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"scripting-guide/advanced_javascript_features/#activex-object-interfaces","title":"ActiveX Object Interfaces","text":"<p>ActiveX objects usually include the following interfaces:</p> <ul> <li>IUnknown\u2014the core interface.

You do not need to know or declare anything special about an object\u2019s definition or typing when working within your script. The fact that JavaScript and COM use slightly different data types is not an issue. WebLOAD simply supports all standard JavaScript and COM data types.</p> <p>WebLOAD JavaScript scripts automatically convert between JavaScript and the corresponding COM data types. The table below illustrates the data type conversions that are supported. The default choices used if no data type information is available are marked in bold in the table.</p> <p>Working with JavaScript and COM data types within a JavaScript script is simple. Passing values from JavaScript scripts as parameters to COM objects can be more complicated. COM does not expect, nor does COM know how to convert from, a JavaScript data type. WebLOAD is responsible for smoothing the interface between JavaScript and COM, converting between JavaScript and the corresponding COM data types when necessary.</p> <p>When the data type is known, WebLOAD automatically converts between JavaScript data types and the corresponding COM data type. If the data type is unknown, WebLOAD checks to see if a TypeInfo library is available for the object. (TypeInfo is usually available.) When available, WebLOAD takes the data type information from the TypeInfo library and completes the conversion as usual.</p> <p>If TypeInfo information is not accessible, WebLOAD uses a basic common-sense heuristic to determine the data type and select the appropriate conversion, based on the preceding default conversion table. For example, if a variable A has been assigned a value of 5, WebLOAD assumes that the variable should be of type Integer.</p> <p>However, relying on sensible assumptions may inadvertently lead to complications. For example, the user may actually intend to pass that variable A as a parameter to a method that expects a String \u201c5\u201d. Or you may be working with an array containing a whole set of variables of unknown data types, a more complicated situation. For these reasons, WebLOAD recommends using casting functions when the data type is unknown, to ensure that the variables are converted to the correct data type before being passed as parameters to an ActiveX object method. The WebLOAD casting functions are described in the following section, *Using Casting Functions for JavaScript and COM Data Types* (on page 113).</p> JavaScript Data Type \u00ae Integer Double Boolean String Date ActiveX Object Array COM Data Type Byte Yes Yes Yes - - - - Short Yes Yes Yes - - - - Long Yes Yes Yes - - - - Float Yes Yes Yes - - - - Double Yes Yes Yes - - - - <p>VARIANT_</p><p>BOOL</p> Yes Yes Yes - - - - Date - - - - Yes - - BSTR Yes Yes Yes Yes - - - IUnknown - - - - - Yes - IDispatch - - - - - Yes - SAFEARRAY - - - - - - Yes"},{"location":"scripting-guide/advanced_javascript_features/#using-casting-functions-for-javascript-and-com-data-types","title":"Using Casting Functions for JavaScript and COM Data Types","text":"<p>WebLOAD recommends using casting functions under the following circumstances:</p> <ul> <li>When no TypeInfo library is available.</li> <li>When you know you are passing mismatched data types.</li> <li>If you receive a TypeError message from COM.</li> </ul> <p>Casting functions ensure that JavaScript variables are converted to the correct data type before being passed as parameters to an ActiveX object method. To explain why casting functions are recommended, this section focuses on how JavaScript and COM work with arrays.</p> <p>Arrays are collections or sets of variables. The values stored within a JavaScript array may either all be of the same data type, (i.e., all integers or all strings), or they may consist of a variety of different data types. COM includes a SafeArray option, asserting that all the items within the array are of the same type. For maximum flexibility, SafeArrays also provide the option of all items being of type Variant.</p> <p>While each item is officially of the \u2018same type\u2019, this actually means that each item may be of any Variant\u2013 compatible data type.</p> <p>While there are very few restrictions on the kinds of data types acceptable by ActiveX objects for array parameters, the one requirement is that whatever is passed must be of the correct (expected) data type. If an ActiveX object method expects to receive an array of type Integer, it must be passed an array of type Integer and not an array of type Variant, even if all the array elements do happen to be integers. When passing a JavaScript array object as a parameter to an ActiveX object method, the items of that array must be converted correctly to the corresponding ActiveX object data types or the method will fail.</p> <p>If nothing is known about the data type of an array\u2019s elements, WebLOAD tries to choose the most logical data type for that array. For example, if all the values in the array appear to be of the same data type, WebLOAD will pass an array of that data type. If the values in the array appear to be of different data types, WebLOAD will pass an array of type Variant. While this approach will almost always work, it may occasionally fail. For example, in the rare event that an array of type Variant coincidentally contains only items that happen to all be of the same Integer data type, WebLOAD will analyze the elements of that array, conclude that it must be of type Integer, and convert it accordingly to an ActiveX array object of type Integer. This may be a logical decision, but the method will fail.</p> <p>To avoid this small possibility of failure during your testing session, WebLOAD provides a complete set of casting functions. While casting functions may be used at any time, explicitly setting a data type is usually recommended only when no TypeInfo library is available, when you know you are passing mismatched data types, or if you receive a TypeError message from COM. (COM errors, which appear as standard error messages on the WebLOAD Console, are usually triggered by an error in the application being tested, for example, by an error in the ActiveX object\u2019s TypeInfo library.)</p> <p>WebLOAD provides the following casting functions:</p> <ul> <li>CByte()</li> <li>CInt()</li> <li>CLng()</li> <li>CDbl()</li> <li>CFlt()</li> <li>CBool()</li> <li>CVARIANT()</li> </ul> <p>These functions take a variable as a parameter and return that value cast to the specified data type. Only legal data type conversions, as listed the table in *Automatic Conversion between JavaScript and COM Data Types* (on page 112), are allowed.</p> <p>For example, assume you had an array that should be passed as data type Variant, but it only holds items with integer values. To prevent problems, use the CVARIANT() function to explicitly cast the array elements to the Variant data type, as follows:</p> <p><code>My\\_variant\\_arr = new Array()</code> </p> <p><code>My\\_variant\\_arr[0] = CVARIANT(1)</code> </p> <p><code>My\\_variant\\_arr[1] = CVARIANT(21)</code> </p> <p><code>My\\_variant\\_arr[2] = CVARIANT(32)</code> </p> <p><code>My\\_variant\\_arr[4] = CVARIANT(44)</code></p> <p><code>Result = RemoteCOMobject.Add(My\\_variant\\_arr)</code></p> <p>Remember, if your array contains elements with a variety of data types, you don\u2019t have to explicitly cast the array elements to force the array to be converted to data type Variant. WebLOAD will understand that this is a Variant array based on the variety of data types found. However, you may always use a casting function if you wish:</p> <p><code>My\\_variant\\_arr = new Array()</code> </p> <p><code>My\\_variant\\_arr[0] = CVARIANT(1)</code> </p> <p><code>My\\_variant\\_arr[1] = CVARIANT(21.1)</code> </p> <p><code>My\\_variant\\_arr[2] = CVARIANT(\"John\")</code></p> <p><code>My\\_variant\\_arr[4] = CVARIANT(new Date(1999,1,1))</code> </p> <p><code>Result = RemoteCOMobject.Concat(My\\_variant\\_arr)</code></p> <p>In another example, assume you had an array that should be passed as data type</p> <p><code>Double</code>. The elements were assigned a variety of Integer and Double data type values. There is no TypeInfo library available. WebLOAD, seeing a combination of integer and double values, will assume that this is an array of data type Variant.</p> <p>However, the method is expecting an array of data type Double. To prevent problems, use the CDbl() function to explicitly cast the integer array elements to the Double data type, as follows:</p> <p><code>My\\_double\\_arr = new Array()</code> </p> <p><code>My\\_double\\_arr[0] = 100.1</code> </p> <p><code>My\\_double\\_arr[1] = CDbl(21)</code> </p> <p><code>My\\_double\\_arr[2] = 22.2</code></p> <p><code>Result = RemoteCOMobject.AddDoubles(My\\_double\\_arr)</code></p>"},{"location":"scripting-guide/advanced_javascript_features/#dcom-over-http","title":"DCOM over HTTP","text":"<p>In today\u2019s work environment, applications are often distributed over a network.

You don\u2019t have to be familiar with the JavaScript language to work with</p> <p>WebLOAD and WebLOAD Recorder, and test applications. JavaScript scripts are recorded through WebLOAD Recorder. As you execute a typical sequence of activities, WebLOAD Recorder records the HTTP protocol level traffic that is generated by the Web browser according to your accesses. By the conclusion of your recording session, a complete JavaScript script file is created.</p> <p>The basic \u2018Building Blocks\u2019 of a recording session are HTTP requests, which are triggered by user actions. Each time a user navigates to a new URL or submits a form, the browser emits an HTTP method and the resulting HTTP request is recorded.</p> <p>Externally, user activities (at the protocol level) are represented on the WebLOAD Recorder desktop by a set of clear, intuitive icons and visual devices arranged in a visual Script Tree. Internally, WebLOAD Recorder automatically creates JavaScript scripts that act as scripts, recreating the HTTP traffic created by the actions of the original user during later test sessions.</p> <p>Most users begin application testing by simply recording and then running a series of basic scripts, without ever looking into a script\u2019s internal Building Blocks to see the actual JavaScript code inside. As their understanding of the WebLOAD Recorder tool set grows, many users decide to expand or tailor their original set of scripts to meet a particular testing need, adding customized features that sometimes require some editing of the JavaScript code within the script itself. WebLOAD Recorder offers a wide range of features and options, for users who wish to add more functionality to their scripts, rather than simply replaying the same set of HTTP methods exactly as originally recorded. Many of these tools are available through the WebLOAD Recorder GUI and do not require any additional programming skills. These tools are documented in the WebLOAD Recorder User Guide. The more complex tools that require some familiarity with JavaScript programming are described in the remaining chapters of this guide, with detailed syntax specifications provided in the WebLOAD JavaScript Reference Guide.</p> <p>Test session scripts are written in JavaScript. JavaScript is an object-oriented scripting language originally developed by Netscape Communications Corporation and is currently maintained by the Mozilla Foundation. JavaScript is best known for its use in conjunction with HTML to automate World Wide Web pages. However, JavaScript is actually a full-featured programming language that can be used for many purposes besides Web automation. WebLOAD and WebLOAD Recorder have chosen JavaScript as the scripting language for test session scripts. WebLOAD Recorder JavaScript scripts combine the ease and simplicity of WebLOAD\u2019s visual, intuitive programming environment with the flexibility and power of JavaScript object-oriented programming.</p>"},{"location":"scripting-guide/programming_your_javascript/#script-tree-structure","title":"Script Tree Structure","text":""},{"location":"scripting-guide/programming_your_javascript/#script-tree-nodes","title":"Script Tree Nodes","text":"<p>JavaScript scripts are represented on the WebLOAD Recorder desktop by a script Tree. Each item that appears in the Script Tree is a script node. As you work in your application during a recording session, WebLOAD Recorder adds nodes to the Script Tree. Each node in the Script Tree represents a single user action at the HTTP protocol level, such as submitting a form or navigating to a new URL. Script Tree nodes provide an intuitive, graphic representation of the underlying JavaScript code that actually implements the user activities to be recreated at run time.</p> <p>The following figure illustrates a typical Script Tree fragment:</p> <p></p> <p>Script Tree nodes are arranged sequentially. The sequential arrangement of icons in the Script Tree means that icons appear in the Script Tree in the order in which the user actions and HTTP methods occurred when originally recorded. URL nodes in a script Tree will appear in the order in which the browser requested each Web page over the course of a recording session. In cases where the browser emits asynchronous requests (for example, while using AJAX), the requests are recorded and appear in the Script Tree in the order that the browser emitted them.</p> <p>Note: WebLOAD Recorder offers users a wide range of tools and features that can add very powerful functionality to a testing script. While users are certainly encouraged to incorporate these tools in their Script Tree, users must also be careful when editing URL nodes in the Script Tree. Because the order of HTTP activities within a script is so significant, changing the sequence of URLs in the Script Tree in effect means changing the sequence of activities, and may destroy the functionality of the script. </p>"},{"location":"scripting-guide/programming_your_javascript/#script-program-structure","title":"script Program Structure","text":"<p>After a user has finished recording a typical session with the system under test, WebLOAD Recorder saves a complete record of all user activities at the protocol level and converts the user activity information to a JavaScript script.

The testing tool, your script, must consume minimal system resources to have as small an impact as possible on the performance of the application being tested. To minimize system overhead when running your test script, WebLOAD recommends using the minimal level of global sharing required to run your test correctly.</p> <p>Variables that are accessible within a single script only have the smallest impact on system performance, as noted in wlGeneratorGlobal Example (on page 52). For maximum efficiency and simplicity, WebLOAD strongly recommends creating and managing user-defined variables through the WebLOAD Recorder GUI, as described in the WebLOAD Recorder User Guide.</p> <p>Values shared between multiple scripts, but within a single Load Generator, are the next most efficient choice. Global values shared system wide should only be included in your script if it is truly necessary to check values or synchronize data shared across multiple Load Generators or machines.</p> <p>To optimize performance times during a test, multiple access requests from multiple sources are accommodated sequentially. Script execution is not held for the Set() or Add() methods, which are queued and processed sequentially. Only the Get() method actually holds a script while waiting for the requested value to be returned.</p> <p>Over the course of a typical test session, multiple script threads may all be accessing, and potentially changing, the values of the same global variables. For example, two threads may each get GlobalVarX, currently set to 10. The two threads may then wish to increment GlobalVarX by 1, setting it to a new value of 11. These two Get() and two Set() commands are processed sequentially, independent of each other. Since each script got an initial value of 10, each script will independently set the value to 11. The final value will be set to 11, even though the variable was actually incremented twice, and should now equal 12. To avoid this potential inconsistency, WebLOAD recommends using the Add() command, which gets, changes, and resets a global value in a single action, ensuring /that each thread always accesses the most current value for a global variable and avoiding potential conflicts between threads.</p>"},{"location":"scripting-guide/programming_your_javascript/#identification-variables-and-functions","title":"Identification Variables and Functions","text":"<p>For performance statistics to be meaningful, testers must be able to identify the exact point being measured.

XML DOM objects <p>XML DOM object set that both accesses XML site information and</p><p>generates new XML data to send back to the server for processing.</p> Properties wlSource Contains the complete HTML source code of the frame, in a read- only string. wlStatusLine Contains the status line of the HTTP header, in a read-only string. wlStatusNumber Contains the HTTP status value, which WebLOAD retrieves from the HTTP header, in a read-only integer. wlVersion Contains the HTTP protocol version, which WebLOAD retrieves from the HTTP header, in a read-only string. Methods wlGetAllForms Retrieves a collection of all forms ( elements) in an HTML page and its nested frames. wlGetAllFrames Retrieves a collection of all frames in an HTML page, at any level of nesting. wlGetAllLinks Retrieves a collection of all links ( elements) in an HTML page and its nested frames."},{"location":"scripting-guide/working_with_http/#using-multiple-ip-addresses","title":"Using Multiple IP Addresses","text":"<p>WebLOAD enables the creation of a single test script that includes multiple IP addresses, simulating the behavior of actual users.</p> <p>Note: Before you enable support of multiple IP addresses, you must first generate additional IP addresses on your machine to use when testing.

The values of MultiIPSupport are:</p> <ul> <li>false \u2013 Use only one IP address. (default)</li> <li>true \u2013 Use all available IP addresses.</li> </ul> <p>Indicate whether WebLOAD should use the same IP or a different IP for every round, by setting the value of the wlGlobals.MultiIPSupportType property which supports the following values:</p> <ul> <li>PerClient \u2013 WebLOAD preserves the current behavior, meaning that there are different IPs per client but the same IP is used for all rounds. This is the default setting.</li> <li>PerRound \u2013 WebLOAD supports the use of a different IP from the pool per client, per round, until the pool is exhausted, after which it returns to the beginning.</li> </ul> <p>The exact number of IPs that WebLOAD supports depends on the operating system being used:</p> <ul> <li>With Unix, WebLOAD uses the gethostbyname() function to access the IP address. There is no limit to the number of IP addresses that WebLOAD supports.</li> <li>With Windows, WebLOAD loads an SNMP agent dll file, through which WebLOAD accesses the IP information. The SNMP agent exists on all Windows versions since Win95 and NT, even if an SNMP agent is not installed. This method queries all of the IPs, one at a time, and places the result in a list maintained in the WebLOAD\u2019s engine code. WebLOAD continues to go over the entire IP list, until it reaches the engine code\u2019s limit of 100,000 IPs.</li> </ul> <p>If for some reason the SNMP does not work, WebLOAD uses another method whose limitation is 35 IPs.</p>"},{"location":"scripting-guide/working_with_http/#generating-ip-addresses-in-the-script","title":"Generating IP Addresses in the script","text":"<p>After enabling the use of all available IP addresses, you can generate additional IP addresses on your machine by setting the TCP/IP properties through the Windows UI.

Different clients</p> <p>\u2013 browsers or JavaScript functions such as Ajax \u2013 perform encoding with slight</p> <p>differences. Encoding form data replaces special characters such as blanks, \u201c&gt;\u201c signs, and so on, with \u201c%xx\u201d (an ASCII hexa number). For example, a space is encoded as \u201c%20\u201d or as a \u201c+\u201d.</p> <p>The Get() method converts a URL address to contain only allowed URL characters.

If there is any discrepancy between the document header information and the HTTP values, WebLOAD will work with the information found in the wlHttp.Header property while also issuing a warning to the user.</p> <p>WebLOAD offers a simple way to reset configuration properties using the Options tab of the Session Control menu. Resetting configuration properties as you run and rerun various testing scenarios allows you to fine tune your tests to match your exact needs at that moment. However, that this real-time configuration setting will be overruled by any configuration properties that are explicitly set by wlHttp.Header within your test scripts. For greatest reliability and flexibility, WebLOAD recommends that you set header properties using the more general wlGlobals, wlLocals, and wlHttp object properties, fine-tuning your test sessions using the WebLOAD Session menu.</p> <p>See Rules of Scope for Local and Global Variables (on page 43), for more information on precedence and priority in script variables. Remember that you cannot override the host header or set a cookie header using the Header property.

WebLOAD does not include the third element (the Send button) in the collection because it does not have a name attribute.  This is a listing of the elements collection:   <pre><code>document.forms[0].elements[0].name = \"yourname\" \n\ndocument.forms[0].elements[0].type = \"text\" \n\ndocument.forms[0].elements[0].value = \"\" \n\ndocument.forms[0].elements[1].name = \"interest\" \n\ndocument.forms[0].elements[1].type = \"SELECT\" \n\ndocument.forms[0].elements[1].selectedindex = 0 \n\ndocument.forms[0].elements[1].options[0].text = \"Modems\" \n\ndocument.forms[0].elements[1].options[0].value = \"Modems\" \n\ndocument.forms[0].elements[1].options[0].selected = true \n\ndocument.forms[0].elements[1].options[1].text = \"CD-ROMs\" \n\ndocument.forms[0].elements[1].options[1].value = \"CD-ROMs\" \n\ndocument.forms[0].elements[1].options[1].selected = false\n</code></pre>     The script can use the above data to post the form back to the server.

These activities may be required by an HTTP server.  &gt; **Note:** You may use the methods of wlCookie to create as many cookies as needed. For example, each WebLOAD client running a script can set its own cookie identified by a unique name.  wlCookie is a local object. WebLOAD automatically creates an independent wlCookie object for each thread of a script. You cannot manually declare wlCookie objects yourself. See the *WebLOAD JavaScript Reference Guide* for a complete syntax specification for the wlCookie object and its methods.  ### How WebLOAD Works with Cookies WebLOAD always accepts cookies that are sent from a server. When WebLOAD connects to a server, it automatically submits any cookies in the server\u2019s domain that it has stored. By default, WebLOAD clears the cookie cache after every round.  The wlCookie object lets you supplement or override this behavior in the following ways:  - A thread can create its own cookies. - A thread can delete cookies that it created.  Except for the above, WebLOAD does not distinguish in any way between cookies that it receives from a server and those that you create yourself. For example, if a thread creates a cookie in a particular domain, it automatically submits the cookie when it connects to any server in the domain.    ### wlCookie Methods The wlCookie object works with the following methods:  - `ClearAll()`\u2014Delete all cookies set by wlCookie in the current thread. - `Delete()`\u2014Delete the cookie identified by the method parameters. The cookie must have been previously created by wlCookie. - `Get()`\u2014Returns the cookie value. If there is more than one cookie with the same parameters it returns the first cookie. - `Set()`\u2014Creates a cookie. You can set an arbitrary number of cookies in any thread. If you set more than one cookie applying to a particular domain, WebLOAD submits them all when it connects to the domain.  &gt; **Note:** Set cookies within the main script of the script. WebLOAD deletes all the cookies at the end of each round. If you wish to delete cookies in the middle of a round, use the Delete() or ClearAll() method.  ### Example: using a cookie Cookies are used by applications to store the application requests on the client side. This enables the client to perform a one-time application request and from then on the request information is retrieved from the client\u2019s cookies.   <pre><code>//Request information entered into the application wlHttp.ContentType = \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" wlHttp.FormData[\"username\"] = \"zadp10\" wlHttp.FormData[\"password\"] = \"Start100\" wlHttp.FormData[\"submit1\"] = \"Login\"\n\n//Setting the cookie\n\nwlCookie.Set(\u201cUserID\u201d, \u201czapd10\u201d, \u201c[www.abcdef.net](http://www.abcdef.net/),\u201d, \u201c/\u201d, \u201cSun, 19- Jun-2011 17:29:00 GMT\u201d)\n\n//WebLOAD submits the cookie [wlHttp.Post(\"https://www.abcdef.net/default.aspx\")](http://www.abcdef.net/default.aspx)\n\n//Getting the cookie\n\nCookieValue = wlCookie.Get(\"UserID\")\n\n//The value returned in CookieValue is \u201czapd10\u201d\n\n\nIn some cases it is also necessary to delete the cookie settings. You can do this by entering:\n\n\n\n//Delete the cookie wlCookie.ClearAll()\n\n\n</code></pre>    ## Handling Binary Data  WebLOAD supports the simulation of binary data sent from the browser to the server. Binary data is handled specially, since it cannot be displayed as JavaScript literals in the script, unlike other types of data that can be displayed, such as numbers or text.  ### Recording Binary Data WebLOAD supports recording binary data in a script in one of the following ways:  - Recording binary data as a data file, which is external to the script. - Encoding binary data in the script, so that you can view and edit the data.  #### Recording Binary Data as a Data File  Modifying the script Options settings in the WebLOAD Recorder enables writing binary data into a data file, which is stored locally. When working with data files, only the name of the file is stored in the script itself.  Recording binary data as a data file, enables WebLOAD to simulate sending binary data to the application, although the data itself cannot be edited in the script.  **To record binary data as a data file:**  1. In WebLOAD Recorder, select **Tools Recording and Script Generation Options**. The Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box appears.  1. In the Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box select the **Post Data**tab.      The Post Data tab appears.      ![Recording and Script Generation Options \u2013 Post Data Tab](../images/script_guide_110.png)    1. In the Add New Type field, enter the binary content-type, such as application/x-amf, which is used for binary content generated by a Flash application.  1. Click **As DATAFILE**.     The binary content-type is added to the DATAFILE block list.  1. In the Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box, select the **Content Types** tab.     The Content Types tab appears.     ![Recording and Script Generation Options \u2013 Content Types Tab](../images/script_guide_111.png)    1. Ensure that the appropriate binary content-type appears in the Recorded Types area. If the content does not appear, add the binary content type in the Add new content type field and click **Add**.  After setting the Record Option settings, binary data is stored in a local data file and the name of the file appears in the script.  The following sample script demonstrates how WebLOAD records binary data as a data file:   <pre><code>function InitAgenda()\n\n{\n\nCopyFile(\"wl2288601006.dat\",\"wl2288601006.dat\")\n\n}\n\nwlGlobals.GetFrames = false wlHttp.Get([\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html\"](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html))\n\nSleep(9056)\n\n\n\nwlHttp.Header[\"Referer\"] = [\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Shop.swf\"](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Shop.swf)\n\nwlHttp.Header[\"Content-type\"] = \"application/x-amf\" wlHttp.Header[\"Content-length\"] = \"58\" wlHttp.DataFile[\"Type\"] = \"application/x-amf\" wlHttp.DataFile[\"Filename\"] = \"wl2288601006.dat\"\n\nwlHttp.Post([\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flashservices/gateway](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flashservices/gateway)\n\n.php\")\n</code></pre>     #### Encoding Binary Data in the script  Modifying the script Options settings in the WebLOAD Recorder enables the encoding of binary data in the script during the recording. Once recorded, the script can be edited, parameterized, and load tested as a regular script.  **To enable encoding binary data in the script:**  1. In WebLOAD Recorder, select the **Tools** \u0086 **Recording and Script Generation Options** dialog box.     The Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box appears.  1. In the Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box select the **Script Generation** tab.     The Script Generation tab appears.     ![Recording and Script Generation Options - Script Generation Tab](../images/script_guide_112.png)  1. Select the **Encode binary data** checkbox.     This enables the user to view and parameterize the binary content.  1. In the Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box, select the **Post Data** tab.     The Post Data tab appears.     ![Recording and Script Generation Options \u2013 Post Data Tab](../images/script_guide_113.png)  1. In the Add New Type field, enter the binary content-type, such as application/x-amf, which is used for binary text generated by a Flash application.  1. Click **As DATA**. The binary content-type is added to the DATA block list.  1. In the Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box, select the **Content Types** tab.     The Content Types tab appears (see [Figure 29](#_bookmark135)).  1. Ensure that the appropriate binary content-type appears in the Recorded Types area. If the content does not appear, add the binary content type in the Add new content type field and click **Add**.     After setting the Record Option settings, when binary data is recorded and encoded in a script, wlHttp.EncodeRequestBinaryData = true is automatically added to the script. This encodes the binary data into the following usable format:    `wlHttp.Data[\"Value\"] = \"%00%00%00%00%00%01%00/com.oreilly.frdg.SearchProducts.getSearch Result%00%02/1%00%00%00%18%0a%00%00%00%01%03%00%06search%02%00%0 4wood%00%00%09\"`  The following sample script demonstrates how WebLOAD handles binary data encoded in the script:   <pre><code>function InitAgenda()\n\n{\n\nIncludeFile(\"wlamf.js\",WLExecuteScript);\n\n}\n\nwlGlobals.GetFrames = false wlHttp.EncodeRequestBinaryData = true\n\nwlGlobals.UserAgent = \"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)\"\n\nwlHttp.Get([\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html\"](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html))\n\nwlHttp.EncodeRequestBinaryData = true\n\nwlHttp.Header[\"Referer\"] = [\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html\"](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html)\n\nwlHttp.Get([\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/history.ht](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/history.htm)m\")\n\nwlHttp.EncodeRequestBinaryData = true\n\nwlHttp.Header[\"Referer\"] = [\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/history.htm\"](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/history.htm)\n\nwlHttp.Get([\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/history.swf\"](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/history.swf))\n\nwlHttp.EncodeRequestBinaryData = true\n\nwlHttp.Header[\"Referer\"] = [\"h](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html)[ttp://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html\"](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html)\n\nwlHttp.Get([\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Shop.swf](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Shop.swf)\")\n\nwlHttp.EncodeRequestBinaryData = true\n\nwlHttp.Header[\"Referer\"] = [\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Shop.swf\"](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Shop.swf)\n\nwlHttp.Data[\"Type\"] = \"application/x-amf\" wlHttp.Data[\"Value\"] =\n\n\"%00%03%00%00%00%01%00%15talkback.returnString%00%02/1%00%00%00% 15%0a%00%00%00%02%02%00%06George%02%00%04Bush\"\n\nwlHttp.Post[(\"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flashservices/gateway](http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flashservices/gateway)\n\n.php\")\n</code></pre>     ## Handling Authentication in the Script  WebLOAD supports working with scripts containing Basic, NTLM, and Kerberos user authentication methods.  WebLOAD handles authentication in playback in the following way:  1. WebLOAD sends a regular request with no request for authentication, to which the server responds with an \u201cunauthorized\u201d error (401), and a prompt to enter a username and password. 1. If WebLOAD is using:     - **Basic authentication**, WebLOAD encrypts the username and password in        wlHttp.Username and wlHttp.Password, and makes a request.     - **NTLM authentication**, WebLOAD sets the following:        wlGlobals.AuthType = \"NTLM\", where NTLM is the default value if no authentication type is specified.     - **Kerberos authentication**, WebLOAD sets the following:        wlGlobals.AuthType = \"Kerberos\".        wlGlobals.KDCServer = . If no value is specified for KDCServer, the authentication type is automatically assumed to be NTLM, even if the AuthType is Kerberos.  The following examples demonstrate the authentication processes in WebLOAD.  **Kerberos authentication:**  `wlGlobals.AuthType = \"Kerberos\"`   `wlGlobals.KDCServer = \"mulier.qalab.internal\"`   `wlHttp.NTPassWord = \"Buga859\"`   `wlHttp.NTUserName = \"qalab.internal\\\\test\"`   `wlHttp.Get(\"\")`     **NTLM authentication:**  `wlGlobals.AuthType = \"NTLM\"`   `wlHttp.NTPassWord = \"Buga859\"`   `wlHttp.NTUserName = \"qalab.internal\\\\test\"`   `wlHttp.Get(\"\")`  OR  `wlHttp.NTPassWord = \"Buga859\"`   `wlHttp.NTUserName = \"qalab.internal\\\\test\"`   `wlHttp.Get(\"\")`    **Basic authentication:**  `wlHttp.PassWord = \"Buga859\"`   `wlHttp.UserName = \"test\"`  `wlHttp.Get(\"\")`"}]}
