   | **Test  Name**                               | The name of the Load test.                                   |
   | **Request  parameters**                      | In this section, specify  the URL of the site to be tested. You can in addition create an HTTP web  service call. |
   | **Request  URL**                             | Specify the URL of the  site to be tested.                   |
   | ***Method\***                                | Optionally, specify a  method for an HTTP web service call, from the drop-down list: **Get**, **Post**, **Put**, or **Delete**. |
   | **Request  Body**                            | Optionally, specify the  web service body for the HTTP web service call. |
   | **HTTP  Headers**                            | Optionally, specify the web service header(s):  Click **Add** for  every header you wish to specify, and select the  header from the dropdown list, or enter a  custom header; then enter a value for the header. |
   | **Sleep**                                    | Specify the sleep time between each URL/API call.            |
   | **Load  Configuration**                      | For each of the following, enter a number, or use the slider tool to  specify the number. |
   | **Max  Virtual Users**                       | The maximum number of  Virtual Users to generate.            |
   | **Ramp up time in minutes**                  | The time interval over  which to increase the load from 0 Virtual Users to the number of virtual  users specified in Max Virtual Users. |
   | **Time to run Max Virtual Users in minutes** | The time interval during  which to run the load at the max number of Virtual Users |
   | **Ramp down time in minutes**                | The time interval over  which to decrease the load in order to return to 0 Virtual User |
   | **Load  Generators**                         | Select the load generator  machines that will participate in the load test, as described in [*Specifying Load Generators for a   load test* ](#_bookmark23)(on page [23](#_bookmark23)). |
   | **Recurrence**                               | Select this option if you  wish to schedule automatic periodic execution of the load test. Refer to [*Setting recurring test runs* ](#_bookmark24)(on page [24](#_bookmark24)). |

   

   

   The URL/API load test generates an increasing load over a set time frame until reaching a defined maximum load size. The maximum load size is then run for a set period after which the load is reduced back to the base load again over a time frame defined by the user. The load increments are calculated automatically by WebLOAD based on the parameters defined. ![ref10]

   Thus, the load will start with 0 Virtual Users and increase over the time frame defined in the **Ramp up time** field to reach the number of Virtual Users defined in the **Max Virtual Users** field. The test will then continue running with the maximum number of Virtual Clients for the period of time defined in the **Time to run Max Virtual Users** field, after which load will return to 0 Virtual Users value over the time frame set in the **Ramp down time** field. 

4. Select one of the following: 

   - **Create Test** – The test definitions are saved. 

   - **Create and Run Test** – The test definitions are saved, and the test starts running immediately. 

   - **Run in Sandbox Mode** – The system saves all the test definitions, but runs a limited test on the settings specified in the **Request Parameters** section while ignoring all the settings in the **Load Configuration**, **Load Generators**, and **Recurrence** sections. 

     This option is intended for SaaS users wishing to run a limited test prior to running the full test specified in the test definitions.  



## Creating a Script Load Test

Use this option to create a load test based on a WebLOAD script that was created in WebLOAD Recorder.

   The Script load test generates an increasing load over a set time frame until reaching a defined maximum load size. The maximum load size is then run for a set period after which the load is reduced back to the base load again over a time frame defined by the user. The load increments are calculated automatically by WebLOAD based on the parameters defined. 

   Thus, the load will start with 0 Virtual Users and increase over the time frame defined in the **Ramp up time** field to reach the number of Virtual Users defined in the **Max Virtual Users** field. The test will then continue running with the maximum number of Virtual Clients for the period of time defined in the **Time to run Max Virtual Users** field, after which load will return to 0 Virtual Users value over the time frame set in the **Ramp down time** field. 

4. Select one of the following: 

   - **Create Test** – The test definitions are saved. 

   - **Create and Run Test** – The test definitions are saved, and the test starts running immediately.

   - **Run in Sandbox Mode** – The system saves all the test definitions, but runs a limited test on the settings specified in the **Scripts** section while ignoring all the settings in the **Load Configuration**, **Load Generators**, and **Recurrence** sections. 

     This option is intended for SaaS users wishing to run a limited test prior to running the full test specified in the test definitions.
