# WebLOAD Console Error Messages

This section describes the errors and log messages that can be generated by WebLOAD Console, as well as the JavaScript compiler and any human errors or user messages detected by WebLOAD Console at run-time. Log messages can also be added to the script by the user. The log messages are displayed in the Log Window.




## Message Severity

Messages fall into four categories:

- Success / Info Message
- Minor Error
- Error
- Severe Error



### Success / Info Message

Success / Info Messages are added to the script by the user. Success / Info Messages can be used in order to facilitate debugging. They do not stop WebLOAD Console from running.



### Minor Error

Minor Errors do not stop WebLOAD Console from running. However, they do indicate suspicious conditions. The source of the problem may be generated by the SUT, the connection to the server, networking etc.



### Error

Errors do not stop WebLOAD Console from running. However, they do stop the round and restart the script for the Virtual Client that encountered the error.



### **Severe Error**

Severe Errors cause the Load Generator, on which the error was generated to stop immediately. A dialog box will be displayed.




## WebLOAD Console Error Messages

Connection errors are usually due to an error in the connection definition. For example, an incorrect name or address specification, or an incorrect proxy designation can cause an error. Most such specification errors are the result of errors in data entry. Verify your configuration settings and addresses with your system administrator.

Careful attention to detail will prevent most errors from ever occurring. Errors are listed in alphabetical order.
