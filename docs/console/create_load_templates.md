# Creating Load Templates

Using WebLOAD Console, you create Load Templates to define the events to occur in the Load Session. This chapter describes how to quickly set up a Load Template. Load Templates define the participants (Clients and Servers) in the Load Session, the scripts to run, the number of Virtual Clients to emulate and the test schedule.



## WebLOAD Console Options for Creating Load Templates
WebLOAD Console provides three options for creating Load Templates:

- Using the WebLOAD Wizard to build a basic Load Template. You define the scripts to run, the Load Machines on which to run the Virtual Clients and the test schedule. After creating a basic template with the wizard, you can change aspects of the configuration through the Console ribbon.

- Using the Goal-Oriented Test Wizard to create goal-seeking performance tests. Rather than running multiple tests to measure the performance at different loads, you can run the Goal-Oriented Test to measure the performance goal that you desire. You define the scripts to run and the goals to achieve and WebLOAD Console automatically schedules the test session and increases the number of Virtual Clients running until your goals are achieved.

- Manually using the Console ribbon.

  

The Load Template material is divided into the following chapters:

- [*Planning a Test Session* ](plan_test_session.md) describes the stages involved in planning and executing a test session.
- [*Connecting to WebRM* ](connect_webrm.md) describes the process of connecting to WebRM and requesting testing resources.
- [*Managing Load Templates and Load Sessions* ](manage_load_templates_sessions.md) provides information about working with Load Templates and Load Sessions.
- [*Creating Load Templates with the WebLOAD Wizard* ](create_template_wizard.md) guides you through a basic template configuration using the WebLOAD Wizard.


- [*Creating Load Templates with Goal-Oriented Test* ](create_load_test_goal.md) teaches you to configure a goal-seeking performance test.
- [*Configuring a Load Template Manually* ](config_load_template.md) provides instructions for configuring a test template manually.

After completing these chapters, you will have the basic skills necessary to create and run your own test.
