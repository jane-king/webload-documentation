# Working with Portfolios

WebLOAD Analytics enables you to create a portfolio of templates that you can open in a single action. Use portfolios to group together commonly used templates to speed up your work.  

> **Note:** Generating, printing, and publishing individual charts within a portfolio or entire portfolios is identical to generating, printing, and publishing charts. For more information, see[` `*Generating Charts* ](#_page20_x54.00_y155.04)on page[ 21.](#_page20_x54.00_y155.04) 



## Creating a Portfolio

When you create a new portfolio, you assign the templates you wish to include by dragging them into your portfolio in the Templates Gallery tree. The assigned templates appear as links within the portfolio. 

> **Note:** If a template is deleted from the Templates Gallery and the portfolio links associated with it are not deleted, unresolved template links appear in the tree marked with a red x. When publishing the portfolio, templates with unresolved links are not published.

1. In the Navigation area, click the **Gallery** tab. The Templates Gallery opens [(Figure 9)](#_page27_x54.00_y564.04). 

1. In the Templates Gallery Right-click in the Templates Gallery and select **New Portfolio**.
